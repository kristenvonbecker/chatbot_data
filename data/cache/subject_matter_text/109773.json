  " bce  Italic languages , certain Indo-European languages that were once spoken in the Apennine Peninsula (modern Italy ) and in the eastern part of the Po valley. These include the Latin , Faliscan , Osco-Umbrian , South Picene , and Venetic languages, which have in common a considerable number of features that separate them from the other languages of the same area\u2014e.g., from Greek and Etruscan . (In a more narrow sense, the term Italic languages excludes Latin and denotes only Osco-Umbrian, South Picene, Faliscan, and Venetic.)",
  "For a long time the Italic languages have been considered to be an Indo-European subfamily like Celtic , Germanic , or Slavic . Today some scholars are inclined to distinguish within the so-called Italic branch at least three independent members of the Indo-European family: Latin (with Faliscan), Osco-Umbrian (with South Picene), and Venetic (if indeed this is an Italic language, as will be assumed in this article). They attribute the similarities\u2014i.e., the unifying phenomena in the division\u2014to a convergence that took place when the speakers of these different idioms were integrated into the \u201cItalic\u201d civilization of the early 1st millennium bce . The culture that resulted is known as the \u201cEtruscan koine.\u201d",
  "Latin is the language of Latium and of Rome ; its earliest known documents date to the 6th century bce . Rich epigraphic evidence and an extensive literature began at the end of the 3rd century bce , at the time when Roman Latin was emerging as the predominant language of Italy. By 100 ce at the latest, Latin had effaced all the other dialects between Sicily and the Alps, with the exception of Greek in the colonies of Magna Graecia .",
  "The other Italic languages\u2014Italic languages in the narrow sense\u2014are known through local and personal names transmitted by Greek and Roman sources, and especially from inscriptions.",
  "Before Latin spread out, Oscan was the most widely spoken group of dialects of the Apennine Peninsula. It was used by the Samnites in Samnium and Campania , by the inhabitants of Lucania and Bruttium, and, with slight variations, by smaller tribes between Latium and the Adriatic coast\u2014the Volsci , Marsi , Paeligni , Vestini , and Marrucini . (Those distinct \u201cminor dialects\u201d within the Oscan language continuum are referred to as Volscian , Marsian, Paelignian, etc., and collectively as Sabellic , or Sabellian, dialects; this term can also refer more generally to the Italic languages other than Latin and Venetic, roughly comparable to the narrow sense of the term Italic languages.) The legendary Sabines , who shared the earliest history of Rome, probably also spoke an Oscan dialect. The most important Oscan texts come from Campanian cities, as do the oldest ones (several so-called Paleo-Oscan, or \u201cPre-Samnite,\u201d vessel inscriptions of the form \u201cI belong to So-and-so,\u201d dating to as early as the mid-6th century bce ). The largest text, a treaty between Nola and Abella from the 2nd century bce , is carved on a stone slab, called the Cippus Abellanus. In Bantia, a nearly unknown town of Lucania, the Tabula Bantina is preserved, the most extensive Oscan inscription. It is a bronze tablet with penal laws concerning municipal administration, written in Latin letters during the first half of the 1st century bce . The oldest Oscan text of any length is the so-called Agnone Tablet of about 250 bce (a small bronze tablet found near Fonte Romito, between Agnone and Capracotta), detailing cultic instructions related to the worship of Ceres and other divinities. The remainder of the Oscan corpus includes diverse material, some of which is of considerable cultural interest (short cultic and sacrificial texts, curse tablets, and several types of municipal inscriptions).",
  "The Umbrian idiom, closely related to Oscan, is known from a few small inscriptions and from the Tabulae Iguvinae ( Iguvine Tables ), which consist of seven bronze tablets found at Gubbio (the ancient Iguvium). Constituting one of the largest and most important epigraphic documents of antiquity, the tablets contain ritual regulations of a sacred brotherhood to which a considerable part of the public cults of Iguvium was delegated. The Tabulae Iguvinae were incised, partly in the Umbrian alphabet and partly in Latin letters, within the last three centuries bce , but portions of the text itself result from a far more remote oral tradition .",
  "Approximately two dozen short inscriptions from the southern part of ancient Picenum (most of them found near Ascoli Piceno and Teramo ) preserve extremely early remains (6th and 5th centuries bce ) of the Italic language now known as South Picene. Formerly referred to as Old Sabellian or Central Adriatic, South Picene shows close affinities to Oscan and Umbrian. (North Picene, known mainly from a 12-line inscription of about 500 bce on a stele from Novilara, is not an Italic language and may not even be an Indo-European language.)",
  " foied.uino.pipafo.cra.carefo Hodie vinum bibam, cras carebo.  Faliscan inscriptions appear only in the immediate surroundings of Falerii (the present Civita Castellana in central Italy), which, except for its dialect, seems to have been a completely Etruscan city. The Faliscan corpus consists mainly of short sepulchral inscriptions, most of which date to the 4th century bce and later. There are, however, several important Archaic Faliscan vessel inscriptions, including some from as early as the 6th century bce that show evidence of poetic composition .",
  "The language represented by inscriptions from the territory of the Veneti \u2014between the Po River , the Carnic Alps , and Istria \u2014is called Venetic. The majority of discoveries come from sanctuaries at Este and L\u00e0gole di Calalzo. The Venetic inscriptions (of which there are about 300, ranging from the 5th to the 1st century bce ) consist almost entirely of brief epitaphs and dedications.",
  "Several very early texts cannot be ascribed with certainty to any of the individual languages listed above but show linguistic features of a broadly Osco-Umbrian/South Picene type. The most important of these is found on an inscribed flask from Poggio Sommavilla (in Sabine territory), dating from the end of the 7th century bce .",

Five \u201cnational\u201d or \u201cnative\u201d alphabets are distinguished:, Faliscan , Oscan , and Umbrian .",
  "The Italic languages must have been brought from the original area of the Indo-European languages, perhaps in eastern parts of central Europe, when their speakers crossed the Alps . This is attested to by a stratum of very old place-names of non-Indo-European origin\u2014e.g., Tarracina (modern Terracina ), Capua \u2014that covers not only the Apennine Peninsula but also Greece and Anatolia . This stratum is ascribed to a \u201cMediterranean\u201d language believed to have dominated large parts of the ancient world before the arrival of the Indo-European peoples. Nothing is known about the date, the path, and the circumstances of the above-mentioned immigration, and none of the many attempts to combine archaeological evidence with linguistic prehistory has led to convincing results. Thus, the only resources available for studying the Italic languages are exclusively linguistic methods of comparative philology.",
  "Many of the phonetic processes that make the attested Italic languages differ from the reconstructed Indo-European language seem to have occurred relatively late in time. The only one that can confidently be placed outside of Italy\u2014that is, before the immigration over the Alps\u2014is the change to ss in combinations of d (dental occlusive, or dental stop) + t . This is a feature common to Celtic , Germanic , and the Italic languages. For example, Latin  visus comes from the older, reconstructed form * wissos \u2018seen\u2019; this is cognate with High German  gi-wiss \u2018surely known\u2019 and Old Irish  ro-fess \u2018is known,\u2019 all of these forms deriving from an Indo-European term * wid-to-s , with d + t . (An asterisk [*] before a word means that it is not attested but reconstructed.)",
  "The development of the Indo-European labiovelar stop k w  is more complex. (A labiovelar stop is a sound pronounced with simultaneous articulation\u2014movement\u2014of the lips and the velum, the soft palate.) From this sound there has resulted a qu in Latin, p in Osco-Umbrian and South Picene, c in Irish, and p in Brythonic Celtic ; e.g., Latin quis \u2018who(ever)\u2019 is cognate with Oscan pis and Umbrian pis (similarly South Picene pim \u2018whom[ever]\u2019 or \u2018which[ever]\u2019), these forms deriving from Indo-European * k w is ; and Irish cia is related to Welsh  pwy , \u2018who,\u2019 derived from Indo-European * k w ei . Some scholars have tried to trace this development back to an Italo-Celtic unity, but the change of Brythonic k w  to p is surely later than the dropping of the p in Common Celtic. It is sounder, therefore, to assume independent processes in the different languages.",
  "Other features developed in Italy itself\u2014e.g., the use of the voiceless dental spirant ( fricative ) f that is shared with Etruscan and is lacking in marginal districts of Venetic. In all Italic languages this f sound replaced the Indo-European voiced aspirated sounds (represented as bh, dh, g w h ) in initial position. Examples of the use of f in Italic are as follows: Latin frater \u2018brother\u2019 = Umbrian frater , from Indo-European * bhr\u0101t\u0113r ; Latin facio \u2018I do, make\u2019 is related to Oscan fakiiad \u2018he should do\u2019 and Venetic fagsto \u2018he made,\u2019 based on an Indo-European stem * dh\u0259-k- . A more recent common process in Latin and Osco-Umbrian is the use of the full system of five short vowels in initial syllables only; short vowels of noninitial syllables in Latin became less open\u2014e.g., facio \u2018I do, make,\u2019 but in-ficio , the compound of in + facio . In Osco-Umbrian these vowels tend to be lost completely\u2014e.g., Umbrian benust \u2018he will have come,\u2019 but Oscan cebnust \u2018he will have come near.\u2019 Some differences between Latin and Osco-Umbrian/South Picene probably arose during the last centuries bce \u2014e.g., Osco-Umbrian/South Picene \u014d changed to u (Oscan d\u00fan\u00fam , South Picene d\u00fano\u00ed , Latin d\u014dnum \u2018gift\u2019), \u0113 became i (Oscan ligud , Latin l\u0113ge \u2018law\u2019 in the ablative singular; South Picene spol\u00edti\u00fa , Latin Spol\u0113tium [name of a town in Umbria , modern Spoleto ]), and final \u0101 developed into o ( vi\u00fa [ \u00fa in the Oscan national alphabet = o ], Latin via \u2018way\u2019). Indo-European voiced aspirated sounds ( bh, dh, g w h ) in internal position probably first became voiced spirants (e.g., sounds such as v ) in all Italic languages and, later, voiced stops in Latin and Venetic and the voiceless spirant f in Osco-Umbrian, South Picene, and Faliscan. Examples of these changes (for Indo-European dh ) are the voiced stop  b in Latin liberi \u2018(free) children\u2019 and Venetic louderobos \u2018children\u2019 (in the dative plural) versus the voiceless spirant f in Oscan loufro- \u2018free\u2019 and Faliscan loferta \u2018freed woman.\u2019 Examples for Indo-European bh are Oscan tfei , Umbrian tefe , South Picene tefe\u00ed versus Latin tibi \u2018to/for you.\u2019",
  "In contrast to the phonology, which shows so many correlations among the Italic languages, there are few definite connections between these tongues in their grammars . A characteristic innovation is the extension of the ablative singular case from o- stems and pronouns, where it occurred originally, to other declension classes: Latin praidad \u2018with the plunder,\u2019 later praeda, meretod \u2018by merit,\u2019 Oscan toutad \u2018by the people,\u2019 slaagid \u2018of the border,\u2019 South Picene ar\u00edtih ( -h represents earlier -d ) \u2018with skill.\u2019 Many of the morphological features common to Osco-Umbrian, South Picene, and Latin are shared by other Indo-European languages; that is, they are not Italic in a specific sense. For example, the a- subjunctive\u2014e.g., Latin faciat \u2018may he do\u2019 and Oscan fakiiad \u2014is also Celtic; passive endings in - r \u2014e.g., Oscan vincter and Latin vincitur \u2018he is conquered,\u2019 South Picene qolof\u00edt\u00far \u2018he honours/supports\u2019 or \u2018honour/support is shown to\u2019\u2014are found in Celtic , Hittite , and Tocharian as well. More important are the discrepancies. For example, the genitive singular of o -stems shows - \u012b in Latin, Faliscan, and Venetic and in the Celtic languages, but - eis in Osco-Umbrian and South Picene; the nominative plural of the same class is marked by - oi in early Latin, Celtic, and Greek but by - \u014ds in Osco-Umbrian, South Picene, Germanic, Sanskrit , and other languages. In addition, the perfect stems of secondary verbs (verbs derived from nouns or from other verbs) are formed by - u - or - v - in Latin, by - t ( t )- in Oscan, by - s - in Venetic, and by a variety of formants in Umbrian\u2014e.g., Latin donavit \u2018he has given\u2019 = Oscan duunated = Venetic donasto , Umbrian combifiansiust \u2018he will have announced\u2019 (with formant -nky- ).",
  "Lexical comparison leads to more specific data about the history of the Italic languages. There are linguistic boundaries called isoglosses that may date back to pre-Italic history: e.g., Oscan humuns , Latin homines , and Gothic gumans \u2018human beings\u2019 derive from an Indo-European root that meant \u2018earth\u2019; and Oscan anam\u00fam \u2018mind\u2019 (accusative singular) is directly related to Latin animus \u2018mind, soul\u2019 and Irish anam \u2018soul,\u2019 these words deriving from an Indo-European root meaning \u2018to breathe\u2019 (compare Greek anemos \u2018wind\u2019). There are many old differences between Latin on the one hand and Osco-Umbrian (and South Picene) on the other. Latin ignis \u2018fire\u2019 = Sanskrit agni , but Umbrian pir \u2018fire\u2019 = Greek p\u0177r = Old English fyr ; Latin aqua \u2018water\u2019 = Gothic ahwa , but Umbrian utur \u2018water\u2019 = Greek hyd\u014dr = Old English w\u00e6ter ; Latin filius, filia \u2018son, daughter,\u2019 but Oscan puklu and South Picene puqloh \u2018son\u2019 = Sanskrit putra , and Oscan fut\u00edr \u2018daughter\u2019 = Greek thygat\u0113r = Gothic dauhtar . Adjectives of totality in Latin are omnis, cunctus, totus , in Osco-Umbrian sollo-, sevo-, allo- (cognate to English all ). \u2018The people\u2019 or \u2018the state\u2019 is expressed in Latin by populus or civitas (the latter literally \u2018citizenship,\u2019 based on civis \u2018citizen\u2019), but by Oscan touto , Umbrian tuta , South Picene to\u00fata = Irish t\u00faath = Gothic thiuda .",
  "Certain lexical fields that reflect the acquisition of the Mediterranean culture show an independent terminology. The following forms strongly suggest that Latin and Osco-Umbrian speakers were not in contact with each other when they began to build cities: Latin porta \u2018gate,\u2019 Oscan veru \u2018gate\u2019; Latin arx \u2018citadel,\u2019 Umbrian ocar \u2018citadel, castle\u2019; Latin moenia \u2018walls, ramparts,\u2019 murus \u2018wall,\u2019 Oscan fe\u00edh\u00fass (accusative plural) \u2018walls.\u2019 On the other hand, Latins and Osco-Umbrians adopted the same terms for \u2018write\u2019 and \u2018read\u2019; Latin scribere \u2018to write,\u2019 Oscan scriftas \u2018written\u2019; Latin legere \u2018to read,\u2019 Paelignian lexe \u2018you will read.\u2019 It is known that the Latin and Osco-Umbrian alphabets are derived from the Etruscan alphabet; the spread of these terms can, therefore, be attributed to a period of Etruscan predominance. Etruscan features are obvious in archaic Italic religion; Osco-Umbrians and Veneti adopted even the Etruscan word for \u2018god\u2019\u2014 ais . Many other religious terms show a close community among Italic peoples; e.g., the Latin forms pius \u2018pious, obedient\u2019 and piare \u2018to honour with religious rites\u2019 are equivalent to Volscian pihom (neuter singular) and Umbrian pihatu (imperative); Latin feriae \u2018religious days\u2019 is related to Oscan fiisiais (ablative plural); and Latin sacer \u2018sacred,\u2019 sacrare \u2018to consecrate, dedicate,\u2019 sanctus \u2018consecrated\u2019 are cognates with Oscan sakrid (ablative singular), sakraf\u00edr (subjunctive passive), saaht\u00fam (neuter singular). These correspondences in religious vocabulary extend to whole phrases, some inherited from Indo-European forms of expression and therefore of very great antiquity: e.g., the Umbrian prayer formula ueiro pequo\u2026salua seritu \u2018keep safe men (and) livestock\u2019 is directly comparable to Latin pastores pecuaque salva servassis \u2018may you keep safe shepherds and livestock\u2019 (in an ancient Roman prayer), and both are cognate with similar expressions in Vedic Sanskrit and Avestan .",
  "The Etruscan supremacy ended with the foundation of local republics in Rome and in other cities of Italy in approximately 500 bce ; when that occurred, the unifying force of Etruscan culture lost its influence. Early republican terminology developed independently; e.g., Latin consul \u2018consul\u2019 but Oscan medd\u00edss designate the first magistrate, to Latin senatus \u2018senate\u2019 corresponds Oscan k\u00famparakine\u00eds (genitive singular), and to Latin comitia \u2018assembly\u2019 the Oscan forms comono or k\u00fambennie\u00eds . The last period of Italic language history is characterized by an increasing influence of Roman models. For example, Oscan ceus \u2018citizen\u2019 is a Latin loanword that stems from a form * ceuis , which existed about 200 bce and was intermediate between Old Latin ceivis and its later form civis ; Oscan a\u00eddil and kva\u00edsstur imitate Latin aedilis and quaestor , terms for offices in the Roman government; and the Veneti adopted the Roman word for \u2018freed man,\u2019 libertus . In addition, the Oscan Tabula Bantina slavishly copied the juridical style and terminology of the Romans.",
  "Beyond vocabulary, the Italic languages share features of expression that are prominent in formal modes of discourse, such as prayers , oaths and curses, and legal formulations. For many such compositions, the distinction between \u201cprose\u201d and \u201cpoetry\u201d is an artificial one: prayers or juridical formulas that otherwise appear to be prose may show elaborate structures dependent on sequences of isosyllabic cola (i.e., phrases with equal numbers of syllables, like lines of verse) or other rhythmic patterns, marked effects arising from antithesis or synonymy, and a high degree of asyndeton (i.e., lack of connective words such as and ). Perhaps most striking is the phonetic feature of alliteration , pervasive throughout early Latin poetry, as well as in formal documents composed in Oscan, Umbrian, and South Picene. For Latin and Umbrian, compare the parallel phrases  s alua s eritu and  s alva s ervassis in the prayer mentioned above, with the latter preceded by  p astores p ecuaque ; an Oscan curse includes the sequence  f akinss, f angvam, b iass, b i\u00edtam \u2018(I hand over to the divinity [i.e., I curse] his) deeds, tongue, strength, life\u2019; and note the concluding sequence  v iat v epet\u00ed \u2018he lies in the tomb\u2019 in the .",
