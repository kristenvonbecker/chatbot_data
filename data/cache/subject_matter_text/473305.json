  "  shearing , in textile manufacturing, the cutting of the raised nap of a pile fabric to a uniform height to enhance appearance. Shearing machines operate much like rotary lawn mowers, and the amount of shearing depends on the desired height of the nap or pile. Shearing may also be applied to create stripes and other patterns by varying surface height. In animal husbandry, shearing is the cutting off of the fleece of sheep and other wool-bearing animals, using special shears."
