  " self-determination , the process by which a group of people, usually possessing a certain degree of national consciousness, form their own state and choose their own government . As a political principle, the idea of self-determination evolved at first as a by-product of the doctrine of nationalism , to which early expression was given by the French and American revolutions. In World War I the Allies accepted self-determination as a peace aim. In his Fourteen Points \u2014the essential terms for peace\u2014U.S. Pres. Woodrow Wilson listed self-determination as an important objective for the postwar world; the result was the fragmentation of the old Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires and Russia\u2019s former Baltic territories into a number of new states.",
  "After World War II , promotion of self-determination among subject peoples became one of the chief goals of the United Nations . The UN\u2019s predecessor, the League of Nations , had also recognized the principle, but it was in the UN that the idea received its clearest statement and affirmation.",
  "The UN Charter clarifies two meanings of the term self-determination . First, a state is said to have the right of self-determination in the sense of having the right to choose freely its political, economic, social, and cultural systems. Second, the right to self-determination is defined as the right of a people to constitute itself in a state or otherwise freely determine the form of its association with an existing state. Both meanings have their basis in the charter (Article 1, paragraph 2; and Article 55, paragraph 1). With respect to dependent territories, the charter asserts that administering authorities should undertake to ensure political advancement and the development of self-government (Article 73, paragraphs a and b; and Article 76, paragraph b)."
