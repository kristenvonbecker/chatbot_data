  "Industrial growth began in the late 18th century with the development of the iron and steel industries in Berks county. After the production of upper Great Lakes ore overshadowed that of Pennsylvania ore, Reading shifted to the fabrication of iron and steel. The opening of the Schuylkill Canal to Philadelphia (1824) and the Union Canal to Lebanon and Middletown on the Susquehanna River (1828) and the completion of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (1884) greatly stimulated industrial growth. In the 1890s, safety-bicycle manufacturing mushroomed. Development of the textile and hosiery industry was started about 1900 by two German technicians, Ferdinand Thun and Henry Janssen, who installed the first braiding and knitting machine in the country. In 1974 Reading became the site of the world\u2019s first multi-tenant manufacturers\u2019 outlet (opened by women\u2019s lingerie manufacturer Vanity Fair), and outlet stores and malls continue to play a prominent role in the local economy. In the early 21st century, local industries included electronic components, batteries, specialty steels, energy-storage technology, and medical devices.",
