  " air space , also spelled Airspace , in international law, the space above a particular national territory, treated as belonging to the government controlling the territory. It does not include outer space, which, under the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, is declared to be free and not subject to national appropriation. The treaty, however, did not define the altitude at which outer space begins and air space ends."
