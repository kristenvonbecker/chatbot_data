  " air force , military organization of a nation that is primarily responsible for the conduct of air warfare. The air force has the missions of gaining control of the air, supporting surface forces (as by bombing and strafing), and accomplishing strategic-bombing objectives. The basic weapon systems of air forces are such military airplanes as fighters, bombers, fighter-bombers, attack aircraft, reconnaissance craft, and training craft. Since the mid-20th century, the air forces of some of the world\u2019s major powers have also operated those nations\u2019 contingents of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as of nuclear-armed long-range bombers. The army and naval branches of a nation\u2019s armed forces may also operate aircraft, but the air force usually remains the prime instrument of a nation\u2019s air power. The organization, command structure, and personnel grades within air forces vary from country to country. ( See also  military aircraft ; air warfare .)"
