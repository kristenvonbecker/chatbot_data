  " invention , in music, any of a number of markedly dissimilar compositional forms dating from the 16th century to the present. While its exact meaning has never been defined, the term has often been affixed to compositions of a novel, progressive character\u2014i.e., compositions that do not fit established categories. The earliest-known use of the term in Premier livre des inventions musicales (1555; \u201cFirst Book of Musical Inventions\u201d) by the Frenchman Cl\u00e9ment Janequin clearly alludes to the composer\u2019s highly original programmatic chansons\u2014secular French part-songs containing extramusical allusions (e.g., imitations of battle sounds and birdcalls). Similarly capricious or novel effects occur in John Dowland\u2019s Invention for Two to Play upon One Lute (1597); Lodovico da Viadana\u2019s Cento concerti ecclesiastici \u2026 Nova inventione (1602; \u201cOne-Hundred Ecclesiastical Concerti\u2026New Invention\u201d), the first sacred collection to require a basso continuo; and Antonio Vivaldi\u2019s Il cimento dell\u2019armonia e dell\u2019invenzione , Opus 8 (1720; \u201cThe Contest Between Harmony and Invention\u201d), which contains, among others, a number of programmatic concerti.",
  "Best known perhaps is the set of two-part inventions and 15 three-part sinfonias (often called Three-Part Inventions ) for harpsichord ( c. 1720) by J.S. Bach, each of which is characterized by the contrapuntal elaboration of a single melodic idea and for which Francesco Bonporti\u2019s Invenzioni for violin and bass (1712) may have served as a model.",
  "Twentieth-century composers of pieces entitled \u201cInvention\u201d include the Austrian Alban Berg and the Russian-American composer Alexander Tcherepnin, who followed Bach\u2019s lead more or less directly."
