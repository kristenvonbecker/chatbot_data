  " Kalanchoe blossfeldiana  kalanchoe , (genus Kalanchoe ),  genus of about 120 species of succulent plants of the stonecrop family ( Crassulaceae ). Most species are native to Madagascar and tropical Africa, and many are popular for their easy culture indoors. As succulents, kalanchoes are relatively carefree houseplants , most requiring considerable direct sunlight\u2014though they will survive bright indirect light\u2014and watering only when thoroughly dry. All species can be propagated readily from leaf or stem cuttings.",
  " Kalanchoe daigremontiana   Most kalanchoe species are perennial herbaceous plants, though some are shrubs and a few are annuals . The thick leaves are highly variable in shape and are commonly waxy or hairy. They are usually borne oppositely along the stems. The yellow, orange, or red flowers have parts in multiples of four. Some species produce clonal plantlets from the base of the plant or along the leaf margins.",
  "The most common species, valued for their unusual foliage, include the panda plant ( Kalanchoe tomentosa ); penwiper plant ( K. marmorata ); velvet leaf, or felt bush ( K. beharensis ); and devil\u2019s backbone, or mother of thousands ( K. daigremontiana ). A range of attractive potted plants, commonly known as florist\u2019s kalanchoe and distinguished by their colourful flowers, have been derived from K. blossfeldiana; they are marketed widely in the winter for their flowers, which may remain fresh for as long as eight weeks."
