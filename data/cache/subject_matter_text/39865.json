  " Chlamydia trachomatis  HeLa cell , a cancerous cell belonging to a strain continuously cultured since its isolation in 1951 from a patient suffering from cervical carcinoma . The designation HeLa is derived from the name of the patient, Henrietta Lacks . HeLa cells were the first human cell line to be established and have been widely used in laboratory studies, especially in research on viruses , cancer , and human genetics .",
  "HeLa cells are a common source of cross-contamination of other cell lines and a suspected cause of numerous instances of cell line misidentification. The HeLa cell genome has also been shown to be highly unstable, housing numerous genomic rearrangements (e.g., abnormal numbers of chromosomes ) in a phenomenon known as chromothripsis."
