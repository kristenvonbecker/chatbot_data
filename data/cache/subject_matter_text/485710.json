[
  " Memento Mori , comic and macabre novel by Muriel Spark , published in 1959. This psychological fantasy was Spark\u2019s most widely praised novel. In characteristically spare, exacting prose, the author looked unflinchingly at old age.",
  "Several elderly London friends receive anonymous telephone calls with a single message: \u201cRemember you must die,\u201d which in Latin is \u201c Memento mori .\u201d Each hears and interprets the words differently. Old rivalries and romances still colour the friends\u2019 relations, and Spark makes clear that their personalities in old age are but a continuation of their earlier lives."
