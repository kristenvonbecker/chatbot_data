  "  celestial sphere , the apparent surface of the heavens, on which the stars seem to be fixed. For the purpose of establishing coordinate systems to mark the positions of heavenly bodies, it can be considered a real sphere at an infinite distance from the Earth. The Earth\u2019s axis, extended to infinity, touches this sphere at the north and south celestial poles, around which the heavens seem to turn. The plane of the Earth\u2019s Equator, extended to infinity, marks the celestial equator. See also  hour circle ; ecliptic ; zenith ."
