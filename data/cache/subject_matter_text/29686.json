  " decay constant , proportionality between the size of a population of radioactive atoms and the rate at which the population decreases because of radioactive decay. Suppose N is the size of a population of radioactive atoms at a given time t , and d  N is the amount by which the population decreases in time d  t ; then the rate of change is given by the equation d  N / d  t = \u2212\u03bb N , where \u03bb is the decay constant. Integration of this equation yields N = N  0  e  \u2212\u03bb t  , where N  0 is the size of an initial population of radioactive atoms at time t = 0. This shows that the population decays exponentially at a rate that depends on the decay constant. The time required for half of the original population of radioactive atoms to decay is called the half-life . The relationship between the half-life, T  1/2 , and the decay constant is given by T  1/2 = 0.693/\u03bb."
