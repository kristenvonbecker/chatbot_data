The term art encompasses diverse media such as painting , sculpture , printmaking , drawing , decorative arts , photography , and installation.",
  "  (Read Sister Wendy\u2019s Britannica essay on art appreciation.)  ",
  "  The various visual arts exist within a continuum that ranges from purely aesthetic purposes at one end to purely utilitarian purposes at the other. Such a polarity of purpose is reflected in the commonly used terms artist and artisan , the latter understood as one who gives considerable attention to the utilitarian. This should by no means be taken as a rigid scheme, however. Even within one form of art, motives may vary widely; thus a potter or a weaver may create a highly functional work that is at the same time beautiful\u2014a salad bowl, for example, or a blanket\u2014or may create works that have no purpose beyond being admired. In cultures such as those of Africa and Oceania, a definition of art that encompasses this continuum has existed for centuries. In the West, however, by the mid-18th century the development of academies for painting and sculpture established a sense that these media were \u201cart\u201d and therefore separate from more utilitarian media. This separation of art forms continued among art institutions until the late 20th century, when such rigid distinctions began to be questioned.",
  "Particularly in the 20th century, a different sort of debate arose over the definition of art . A seminal moment in this discussion occurred in 1917, when Dada artist Marcel Duchamp submitted a porcelain urinal entitled Fountain to a public exhibition in New York City . Through this act, Duchamp put forth a new definition of what constitutes a work of art: he implied that it is enough for an artist to deem something \u201cart\u201d and put it in a publicly accepted venue. Implicit within this gesture was a challenge to the established art institutions\u2014such as museums, exhibiting groups, and galleries\u2014that have the power to determine what is and is not considered art. Such intellectual experimentation continued throughout the 20th century in movements such as conceptual art and minimalism . By the turn of the 21st century, a variety of new media (e.g., video art ) further challenged traditional definitions of art.",
