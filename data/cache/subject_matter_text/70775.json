[
  " Syrian Catholic Church , an Eastern Catholic church of the Antiochene rite, in communion with Rome since the 17th century. In the 5th century, the Christians of Syria largely repudiated the rulings of the Council of Chalcedon (451), which had interpreted the Christological position of the Syrians as well as that of many other Asian and African churches as a monophysite heresy. Attempts at unification with Rome were made, without success, in 1237 and 1247. With the establishment of the Capuchins and Jesuits in Aleppo in 1626, however, conversions to Catholicism followed, and Andrew Akhidjan, a Syrian Catholic priest, was elected bishop of Aleppo (1656) and then patriarch of all Syrians (1662). Because of hostile relations with the non-Chalcedonian Christians, however, a consistent succession of Catholic bishops was not established until 1782, with the election of Michael Jarweh as bishop of Aleppo. The patriarchs resided successively in Dayr al-Zafaran, Sharfeh, Aleppo, Mardin (in Turkey), and finally Beirut. There are patriarchal vicariates or exarchies in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt, five archdioceses (Aleppo, Baghdad, Damascus, Homs, and Mosul), and one diocese (Hassakeh). Catholic Syrians observe the Liturgy of St. James in Syriac, though certain readings are in Arabic, the language spoken by the faithful."
