  " Nanking porcelain , Pinyin Nanjing , Chinese blue-and-white porcelain made for export during the Qing dynasty (especially in the reign of Kangxi, 1661\u20131722) at Jingdezhen. It was shipped to Europe in great quantity from the port of Nanking (Nanjing); as a result, Western dealers in the 19th century used the city\u2019s name when referring to the porcelain.",
  "Though the porcelain was made for export, the shapes and decoration were mostly from Chinese traditions. The porcelain varied in quality; the glaze could become very gray and the decoration was often rudimentary. Much of the polychrome porcelain known as \u201cCanton ware\u201d was actually produced in white at Nanking and sent to Canton for painting. English potters extensively copied and adapted Nanking decoration."
