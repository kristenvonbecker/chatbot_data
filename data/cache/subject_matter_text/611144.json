  "  Sting , byname of Gordon Sumner , original name in full Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner , (born October 2, 1951, Wallsend, Northumberland, England), British singer and songwriter known both for being the front man of the band the Police and for his successful solo career that followed. His musical style was distinguished by its intermingling of pop , jazz , world music , and other genres.",
  "Gordon Sumner grew up in a Roman Catholic family and attended Catholic grammar and secondary schools. He was a music enthusiast from an early age, having a special fondness for the Beatles as well as for jazz musicians Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane . In 1971, after a brief stint at the University of Warwick in Coventry and a series of odd jobs, Sumner enrolled at Northern Counties Teachers Training College (now Northumbria University) intending to become a teacher. While in school he performed in local clubs, mostly with jazz bands such as Phoenix Jazzmen and Last Exit. He received the nickname \u201cSting\u201d from one of his Phoenix Jazzmen bandmates because of the black-and-yellow striped sweater he often wore while performing. After graduating in 1974, Sting taught at St. Paul\u2019s First School in Cramlington for two years.",
  "In 1977 he moved to London and teamed up with musicians Stewart Copeland and Henri Padovani (who was soon replaced with Andy Summers). With Sting on bass , Summers on guitar , and Copeland on drums , the trio formed a new-wave band they called the Police. They became enormously successful but disbanded in 1984, at their peak. In 1983 the Police had won two Grammy Awards (best pop performance and best rock performance by a group with vocal), and Sting won song of the year for \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d as well as best rock instrumental performance for the soundtrack of the film Brimstone & Treacle (1982), in which he also had an acting role.",
  "For his first solo album, The Dream of the Blue Turtles (1985), Sting switched from bass to guitar. The album was a big success and had the standout singles \u201cIf You Love Somebody Set Them Free\u201d and \u201cFortress Around Your Heart.\u201d The album included collaborations with jazz musician Branford Marsalis and continued to show the musical versatility that Sting had introduced with the Police. Sting\u2019s next album, \u2026Nothing like the Sun (1987), included collaborations with Eric Clapton and with former bandmate Summers and hits such as \u201cFragile,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll Be Together,\u201d \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d and \u201cBe Still My Beating Heart.\u201d",
  "Beginning in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sting acted in numerous films, including Quadrophenia (1979), Dune (1984), and Julia and Julia (1987). During the 1980s Sting also became recognized for his interest in social causes. He performed at Live Aid , a benefit concert for famine relief in Ethiopia , in 1985, and in 1986 and 1988 he performed at the Amnesty International concerts for human rights . In 1987 he and his future wife, Trudie Styler, cofounded the Rainforest Foundation, an organization to protect the rainforest and its indigenous peoples. He continued to be a vocal advocate for human rights and environmental causes throughout his career.",
  "Sting released four albums during the 1990s. The Soul Cages (1991), a darker album reflecting the recent loss of his father, did not fare as well his previous two solo albums. But 1993\u2019s Ten Summoner\u2019s Tales was a triple-platinum album (selling more than three million copies), and Sting won that year\u2019s Grammy for best male pop vocal performance with \u201cIf I Ever Lose My Faith in You.\u201d He released Mercury Falling in 1996 and had a big hit with Brand New Day in 1999, especially with the album\u2019s title song and \u201cDesert Rose,\u201d which featured Algerian rai singer Cheb Mami . That album also went triple platinum and in 1999 won the Grammys for best pop album and for best male pop vocal performance for the single \u201cBrand New Day.\u201d",
  "In the 21st century Sting continued to record prolifically and tour regularly. In 2003 he not only won a Grammy for his duet with Mary J. Blige , \u201cWhenever I Say Your Name,\u201d from the album Sacred Love (2003), but he also published an autobiography, Broken Music . Sting branched out into classical music in 2006 with Songs from the Labyrinth , his adaptation of a collection of songs by Elizabethan songwriter John Dowland . The following year and into 2008, Sting reunited with Summers and Copeland for the highly successful Police Reunion Tour. Later he released If on a Winter\u2019s Night\u2026 (2009), an album of traditional folk songs, and an ambitious album of orchestral arrangements of his old songs, Symphonicities (2010). For the latter he toured with London\u2019s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra .",
  "In the summer of 2014 The Last Ship , a musical written by Sting and inspired by his childhood in the shipbuilding town of Wallsend , had its off-Broadway debut in Chicago and was praised by critics. It debuted on Broadway that fall, but, as it began to founder, Sting joined the cast in the lead role; the production closed in 2015. An album of the same name (released 2013) was the first recording of new music Sting had released in about a decade. He returned to his rock roots for 57th & 9th (2016), and two years later he collaborated with reggae star Shaggy for his first duets album, 44/876 (2018), which won a Grammy for best reggae album. For My Songs (2019), Sting reinterpreted a number of his classics, including some originally recorded with the Police.",
  "Sting contributed music to numerous movie soundtracks, notably the animated Disney movie The Emperor\u2019s New Groove (2000), as well as the romantic comedy Kate & Leopold (2001) and the Civil War drama Cold Mountain (2003). He earned Academy Award nominations for the songs he contributed to each of them (2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively) and won a Golden Globe (2002) for the song \u201cUntil\u2026\u201d from Kate & Leopold . In addition to more than 15 Grammys, Sting also won numerous Brit Awards (the British equivalent of the Grammys) for his work with the Police as well as for his solo work. In 2002 he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2004 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).
