  " Rappaccini\u2019s Daughter , allegorical short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne , first published in United States Magazine and Democratic Review (December 1844) and collected in  Mosses from an Old Manse  (1846).",
  "Rappaccini, a scholar-scientist in Padua, grows only poisonous plants in his lush garden. His lovely daughter, Beatrice, has been nurtured on poison and is sustained by her father\u2019s toxic plants. Giovanni, a student who lives next door to Rappaccini, falls in love with Beatrice and becomes contaminated by the garden\u2019s poisonous aura. The antidote he is given cures him; when he gives it to Beatrice, however, she drinks it and dies."
