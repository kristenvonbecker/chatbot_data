  " She Done Him Wrong , American romantic comedy film, released in 1933, that helped establish both Mae West and Cary Grant as major movie stars.",
  "The film is set in 1890s Manhattan and centres on Lady Lou (played by West), who works at a saloon and is the mistress of its crooked owner, Gus Jordan (Noah Beery, Sr.). As Gus\u2019s criminal activities begin to fall under the suspicion of a candidate for sheriff (David Landau), Lou falls for Captain Cummings (Cary Grant), a mission worker who frequents the bar. After a manic string of events that leads Lou to inadvertently kill one of Gus\u2019s accomplices, the saloon is raided by Cummings, who reveals that he is an undercover policeman. Lou is apprehended along with Gus and several others, but once they are outside, Cummings escorts her to a coach, where he presents her with a diamond ring.",
  "Though She Done Him Wrong marked West\u2019s first leading role, she was already a major force in show business by the time it was produced, having starred on the stage since the age of seven. In fact, the film was based on her controversially seductive play Diamond Lil (1928), and it retained in the film adaptation one of her most famous (and often transposed) lines, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up sometime and see me?\u201d West\u2019s salacious persona caused concern for Paramount Pictures , but the film\u2019s success helped to rescue the studio from a dire financial period. However, the suggestiveness of the script and West\u2019s liberated view of female sexuality gave impetus to the new guidelines for industry censorship known as the Hays Production Code , which had been enacted in 1930 but were not widely enforced until the year after the film was produced."
