  " chemical hydrology , also called Hydrochemistry , subdivision of hydrology that deals with the chemical characteristics of the water on and beneath the surface of the Earth. Water in all forms and modes of occurrence is affected chemically by the materials with which it comes into contact. Often called the universal solvent, water has the ability to dissolve many elements in significant quantities. Chemical hydrology concerns itself with the processes involved and thus includes studies of exceedingly diverse phenomena. The transport of salts from land to sea (by erosion of rocks and surface runoff) and from sea to land (by evaporation, cloud formation, and precipitation), the age and origin of groundwater in desert regions, and the paleotemperature determinations based on isotope analyses of ice sheets and glaciers are a few examples."
