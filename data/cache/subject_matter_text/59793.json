  " photo-ionization , the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter resulting in the dissociation of that matter into electrically charged particles. The simplest example, the photoelectric effect ( q.v. ), occurs when light shines on a piece of metal, causing the ejection of electrons. Another category of photo-ionization involves the disruption of covalent chemical bonds, producing positively and negatively charged fragments; such a reaction is often called the primary process of a photochemical reaction ( q.v. )."
