  " Tower of the Winds , also called Horologium, Greek Horologion (\u201cTimepiece\u201d) , building in Athens erected about 100\u201350 bc by Andronicus of Cyrrhus for measuring time. Still standing, it is an octagonal marble structure 42 feet (12.8 m) high and 26 feet (7.9 m) in diameter. Each of the building\u2019s eight sides faces a point of the compass and is decorated with a frieze of figures in relief representing the winds that blow from that direction; below, on the sides facing the sun, are the lines of a sundial. The Horologium was surmounted by a weather vane in the form of a bronze Triton and contained a water clock (clepsydra) to record the time when the sun was not shining. The Greeks invented the weather vane; the Romans used them in the belief that the wind\u2019s direction could foretell the future.",
  "Initially described by the Roman architect Vitruvius (1st century bc ), the Tower of the Winds was fancifully reconstructed in the 16th-century editions of his work by Cesare Cesariano and Giovanni Rusconi. Although these fanciful images influenced designs by 17th-century English architects Christopher Wren and Nicholas Hawksmoor, accurate illustrations were not published until 1762, when they appeared in volume one of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett\u2019s The Antiquities of Athens . The Tower of the Winds was subsequently influential in the Greek Revival, notably in the versions of it built by Stuart in the landscaped pairs at Shugborough, Staffordshire, Eng. ( c. 1764), and at Mount Stuart, County Down, Ire. (1782), and in James Wyatt\u2019s more imaginative Radcliffe Observatory Tower, Oxford, Eng. (1776)."
