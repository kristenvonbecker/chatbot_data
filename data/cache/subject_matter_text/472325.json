[
  "  field , in physics , a region in which each point has a physical quantity associated with it. The quantity could be a number, as in the case of a scalar field such as the Higgs field , or it could be a vector , as in the case of fields such as the gravitational field, which are associated with a force . Objects fall to the ground because they are affected by the force of Earth \u2019s gravitational field ( see  gravitation ). A paper clip, placed in the magnetic field surrounding a magnet , is pulled toward the magnet, and two like magnetic poles repel each other when one is placed in the other\u2019s magnetic field. An electric field surrounds an electric charge ; when another charged particle is placed in that region, it experiences an electric force that either attracts or repels it. The strength of a field, or the forces in a particular region, can be represented by field lines; the closer the lines, the stronger the forces in that part of the field.
