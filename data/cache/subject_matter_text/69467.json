  " The Stars and Stripes , newspaper for U.S. military personnel that has been published periodically as either a weekly or a daily since single editions appeared during the American Civil War (1861\u201365). It was revived in 1918 as a weekly for U.S. troops in Europe at the end of World War I , was discontinued in 1919, and was reestablished in 1942, first as a weekly and then as a daily. A European edition has been published continuously since that time. A Pacific edition was launched in 1945. At the height of U.S. involvement in World War II , the circulation of the European edition of The Stars and Stripes was estimated at more than one million. In 2003 a Middle East edition began publication.",
  "Many outstanding writers, editors, cartoonists, and photographers have worked for The Stars and Stripes . The paper is under the jurisdiction of the Defense Media Activity, a part of the office of the U.S. assistant secretary of defense for public affairs. In light of the paper\u2019s military sponsorship, the relative freedom that it enjoys from military censorship and control has been remarkable and occasionally controversial."
