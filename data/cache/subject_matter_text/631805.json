One of the first written records of the term is from the South English Legendary , a collection of saints\u2019 lives ( c. 1300): \u201cThis on schal beo fair blu cloth, / This othur grene\u201d (\u201cThis one shall be fair blue cloth, / This other green\u201d).",
  "  Pigments for blue have come from azurite, ultramarine, smalt, indigo, a double oxide of cobalt and aluminum, and artificial chemical compounds. Indigo was used as a dye to colour cloth for trousers, which became known as blue jeans.",
  "  In addition to the colour wheel, various other colour systems have been used to classify blue. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner\u2019s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint \u201cPrussian Blue\u201d is compared to the \u201cBeauty Spot on Wing of Mallard Drake,\u201d the \u201cStamina of Bluish Purple Anemone,\u201d and \u201cBlue Copper Ore.\u201d In the Munsell colour system \u2014adopted in the 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry\u2014one of the many variations of blue is identified as 5PB 4/14."
