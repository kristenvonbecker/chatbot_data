  " cave art , generally, the numerous paintings and engravings found in caves and shelters dating back to the Ice Age (Upper Paleolithic ), roughly between 40,000 and 14,000 years ago. See also  rock art .",
  " bce  The first painted cave acknowledged as being Paleolithic, meaning from the Stone Age , was Altamira in Spain . The art discovered there was deemed by experts to be the work of modern humans ( Homo sapiens ). Most examples of cave art have been found in France and in Spain, but a few are also known in Portugal , England , Italy , Romania , Germany , Russia , and Indonesia. The total number of known decorated sites is about 400.",
  "Most cave art consists of paintings made with either red or black pigment. The reds were made with iron oxides (hematite), whereas manganese dioxide and charcoal were used for the blacks. Sculptures have been discovered as well, such as the clay statues of bison in the Tuc d\u2019Audoubert cave in 1912 and a statue of a bear in the Montespan cave in 1923, both located in the French Pyrenees . Carved walls were discovered in the shelters of Roc-aux-Sorciers (1950) in Vienne and of Cap Blanc (1909) in Dordogne. Engravings were made with fingers on soft walls or with flint tools on hard surfaces in a number of other caves and shelters.",
  "Representations in caves, painted or otherwise, include few humans, but sometimes human heads or genitalia appear in isolation. Hand stencils and handprints are characteristic of the earlier periods, as in the Gargas cave in the French Pyrenees. Animal figures always constitute the majority of images in caves from all periods. During the earliest millennia when cave art was first being made, the species most often represented, as in the Chauvet\u2013Pont-d\u2019Arc cave in France, were the most-formidable ones, now long extinct\u2014cave lions, mammoths , woolly rhinoceroses , cave bears . Later on, horses , bison , aurochs , cervids , and ibex became prevalent, as in the Lascaux and Niaux caves. Birds and fish were rarely depicted. Geometric signs are always numerous, though the specific types vary based on the time period in which the cave was painted and the cave\u2019s location.",
  "Cave art is generally considered to have a symbolic or religious function, sometimes both. The exact meanings of the images remain unknown, but some experts think they may have been created within the framework of shamanic beliefs and practices. One such practice involved going into a deep cave for a ceremony during which a shaman would enter a trance state and send his or her soul into the otherworld to make contact with the spirits and try to obtain their benevolence.",
  "Examples of paintings and engravings in deep caves\u2014i.e., existing completely in the dark\u2014are rare outside Europe, but they do exist in the Americas (e.g., the Maya caves in Mexico, the so-called mud-glyph caves in the southeastern United States), in Australia (Koonalda Cave, South Australia), and in Asia (the Kalimantan caves in Borneo , Indonesia, with many hand stencils). Art in the open, on shelters or on rocks, is extremely abundant all over the world and generally belongs to much later times.",

Ucko and Andr\u00e9e Rosenfeld , Paleolithic Cave Art (1967); Jean Clottes , Cave Art (2008); and Christine Desdemaines-Hugon , Stepping Stones: A Journey Through the Ice Age Caves of the Dordogne (2010).
