  " Math , in the Welsh collection of stories known as the Mabinogion , king of Gwynedd in the North. He is also the brother of D\u00f4n , who is probably the Welsh counterpart of the Irish goddess Danu . Whenever at peace, it was necessary for Math to have his feet upon a virgin\u2019s lap. The virgin who held Math\u2019s feet was raped by one of his nephews, Gilfaethwy, and both he and his brother Gwydion were punished for the act by Math. Later, Math\u2019s niece Arianrhod (sister of Gilfaethwy and Gwydion) tried for the position of footholder, but during the test of her virginity she gave birth to two children, one of whom was Lleu .",
  "Together with Gwydion, Math helped Lleu in many ways, creating an artificial wife, Blodeuedd , for him and helping him to avenge her eventual unfaithfulness. Together with Gwydion, Math was responsible for the introduction of pigs\u2014supposedly from the otherworld into North Wales\u2014an aspect which points to a role as a fertility figure."
