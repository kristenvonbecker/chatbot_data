  " mean free path , average distance an object will move between collisions. The actual distance a particle, such as a molecule in a gas, will move before a collision, called free path, cannot generally be given because its calculation would require knowledge of the path of every particle in the region. The probability ( dP ) that a molecule will move a distance between two points ( x and x + dx ) without collision is proportional to an exponential factor; that is, dP = e  - x / \u03bc   dx , in which e is the base of natural logarithms. The constant \u03bc is the mean free path and is the average (mean) distance traveled by a molecule between collisions. The mean free path of an oxygen gas molecule under a pressure of 1 atmosphere at 0\u00b0 C is about 6 \u00d7 10 -6 cm (2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 inch)."
