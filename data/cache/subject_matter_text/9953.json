  " associative learning , in animal behaviour, any learning process in which a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus. In its broadest sense, the term has been used to describe virtually all learning except simple habituation ( q.v. ). In a more restricted sense, it has been limited to learning that occurs through classical and instrumental conditioning ( see  conditioning )."
