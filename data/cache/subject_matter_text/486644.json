  " The Skin of Our Teeth , comedy in three acts by Thornton Wilder , performed and published in 1942. Known for its experimental representation of all of human history, it won Wilder one of his three Pulitzer Prizes .",
  "With a cast of characters that includes a dinosaur and drum majorettes, The Skin of Our Teeth employs bizarre anachronisms and audience-involvement techniques to argue that human experience is much the same whatever the time or place. From their living room in New Jersey, George and Maggie Antrobus (from the Greek anthropos , \u201chuman\u201d), their promiscuous daughter Gladys, hostile and destructive son Henry (who represents the biblical Cain ), and maid Sabina (who represents Lilith, the eternal temptress) face the trials of humanity through the ages, from icy destruction to flood and war."
