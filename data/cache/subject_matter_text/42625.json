  " intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) , also called equatorial convergence zone , belt of converging trade winds and rising air that encircles the Earth near the Equator. The rising air produces high cloudiness, frequent thunderstorms, and heavy rainfall; the doldrums, oceanic regions of calm surface air, occur within the zone. The ITCZ shifts north and south seasonally with the Sun. Over the Indian Ocean, it undergoes especially large seasonal shifts of 40\u00b0\u201345\u00b0 of latitude."
