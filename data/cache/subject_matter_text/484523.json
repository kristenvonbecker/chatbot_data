  " A Delicate Balance , drama in three acts by Edward Albee , published and produced in 1966 and winner of a Pulitzer Prize in 1967. The play, about a middle-aged couple\u2019s struggle to restore the \u201cbalance\u201d of their routine after it has been threatened by intruding friends, is representative of the playwright\u2019s concerns with the hidden terrors of everyday life.",
  "The drama is set in the living room of an upper-middle-class home in suburbia. Using a relatively simple story of a frightened couple who ask their friends for refuge, Albee examined illusion and loss in American families. Although the play was criticized for repeating the structure and thematic content of his  Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  , it stood as a dark comic portrait of modern angst."
