  "   Red was the first basic colour term added to languages after  black  and  white  . The word red derives from Sanskrit rudhira and Proto-Germanic rauthaz . One of the first written records of the term is from an Old English translation (897 ce ) of Pope St. Gregory the Great \u2019s Pastoral Care : \u201cOn th\u00e6s sacerdes hr\u00e6gle sceold\u0153n hangian bellan & ongemong th\u00e6m bellum reade apla\u201d (\u201cOn the priest\u2019s robes should hang bells and among the bells red pomegranates\u201d).",
  " Assumption Assumption  Pigments for red come from madder, red lead, red ochre, cinnabar, and artificial chemical compounds. The red pigment used for the figures\u2019 robes in Titian \u2019s altarpiece The Assumption (1516\u201318) is vermilion, which is derived from ground cinnabar.",
  "    In addition to the colour wheel, various other colour systems have been used to classify red. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner\u2019s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint \u201cScarlet Red\u201d is compared to the \u201cScarlet Ibis or Curlew,\u201d the \u201cLarge red Oriental Poppy,\u201d and \u201cLight red Cinnaber.\u201d In the Munsell colour system \u2014adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry\u2014one of the many variations of red is identified as 7.5R 4/20."
