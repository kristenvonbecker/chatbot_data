  " gender , in language, a phenomenon in which the words of a certain part of speech, usually nouns, require the agreement, or concord, through grammatical marking (or inflection), of various other words related to them in a sentence. In languages that exhibit gender, two or more classes of nouns control variation in words of other parts of speech (typically pronouns and adjectives and sometimes verbs). These other words maintain constant meaning but vary in form according to the class of the word that controls them in a given situation.",
  "Among modern Indo-European languages such as French, Spanish, and Italian, nouns are classified into two genders, masculine and feminine. Russian and German nouns are grouped into three genders, the third being neuter. While nouns referring to masculine or feminine beings almost always take the logical gender in these languages, for most other nouns the gender is arbitrary.",
  "In the following examples from French, the indefinite article and the adjective display a change in form depending on whether the noun that they modify is masculine ( po\u00e8me, \u201cpoem\u201d) or feminine ( pi\u00e8ce, \u201cplay\u201d): un po\u00e8me int\u00e9ressant, \u201can interesting poem,\u201d but une pi\u00e8ce int\u00e9ressante, \u201can interesting play.\u201d",
  "Swahili and many other languages have a gender system in which the relationship between the logical category of an object and its grammatical gender is specified to a much greater degree. Gender classes in such languages may include animate beings, inanimate objects, plants, animals, tools, and objects of a particular shape.",
  "English does not have \u201cgrammatical gender\u201d; its way of expressing relationships that have to do with the sex or animateness of entities is based on real-world awareness (\u201cnatural gender\u201d), in which males are \u201che,\u201d females are \u201cshe,\u201d and inanimates are \u201cit.\u201d Imaginative usage may interfere with this pattern, of course, as when a ship or country is referred to as \u201cshe.\u201d"
