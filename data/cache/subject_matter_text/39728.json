  " Brissopsis lyrifera  heart urchin , any echinoid marine invertebrate of the order Spatangoidea (phylum Echinodermata), in which the body is usually oval or heart-shaped. The test (internal skeleton) is rather fragile with four porous spaces, or petaloids. The body is covered with fine, usually short spines.",
  "Heart urchins live in burrows lined with mucus. Long tentacles (modified tube feet) reach out over the sand to pick up small particles of food; other tube feet have respiratory and sensory (not locomotive) functions. Movement is carried out by means of the spines.",
  "The common heart urchin ( Echinocardium cordatum ) occurs in all oceans. Spatangus purpureus is common on the coasts of western Europe, the Mediterranean, and western Africa."
