  " art for art\u2019s sake , a slogan translated from the French l\u2019art pour l\u2019art, which was coined in the early 19th century by the French philosopher Victor Cousin . The phrase expresses the belief held by many writers and artists, especially those associated with Aestheticism , that art needs no justification, that it need serve no political, didactic, or other end."
