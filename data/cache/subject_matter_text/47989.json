[
  " levitation , rising of a human body off the ground, in apparent defiance of the law of gravity. The term designates such alleged occurrences in the lives of saints and of spiritualist mediums, generally during a s\u00e9ance; levitation of furniture and other objects during a s\u00e9ance has also been reported. Levitation of witches and other figures of folklore is called transvection and is said to involve the rubbing of \u201cflying ointment\u201d on their bodies before flying to the sabbath ( see  witches\u2019 sabbath ). The levitation of saints is usually directly upward, whereas that of witches has the dynamic purpose of transportation. Theologians long debated whether transvection was illusion or fact; levitation, however, has been subject to less controversy, though its practice has often been discouraged."
