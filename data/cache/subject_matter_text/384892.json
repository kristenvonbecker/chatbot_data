  " Delta , city, Millard county, west-central Utah , U.S. Delta is one of the few Utah towns to have been founded in the 20th century with little involvement from the Mormon church, which tightly controlled settlement in the region. Originally an agricultural cooperative called Melville, founded in 1906, the community was reorganized in 1911 and renamed Delta by the Delta Land and Management Company (an investment firm). At first a centre of sugar beet production, Delta developed a diversified agricultural economy and became a leading producer of alfalfa in the 1920s. Fluorspar mining and electricity production contribute to the local economy, as does tourism. The Great Basin Historical Society Museum was opened in 1989 and is an important local attraction. On the museum\u2019s grounds stands a restored barracks from the Topaz Relocation Center, an internment camp used during World War II to confine Japanese Americans from the San Francisco area. Inc. 1911. Pop. (2000) 3,209; (2010) 3,436."
