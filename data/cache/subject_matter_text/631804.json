  "   Green is a basic colour term added to languages before or after yellow , following  black  ,  white  , and red . The word green derives from Proto-Germanic gr\u014dni and Old English grene . One of the first written records of the term is from the Caedmon Manuscript ( c. 1000 ce ): \u201cAdam stop / On grene gr\u00e6s, gaste geweorthad\u201d (\u201cAdam stepped / On green grass, soul made worthy\u201d).",
  "  Pigments for green come from malachite, cobalt oxide, zinc oxide, copper acetate, and artificial chemical compounds. In the 19th century, green pigment made with copper arsenite was known for its toxicity, and some supporters of Napoleon claimed that the fumes from the green wallpaper at Longwood House on St. Helena island, his place of exile, contributed to his death.",
  "  In addition to the colour wheel, various other colour systems have been used to classify green. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner\u2019s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint \u201cDuck Green\u201d is compared to the \u201cNeck of Mallard,\u201d the \u201cUpper Disk of Yew Leaves,\u201d and \u201cCeylanite.\u201d In the Munsell colour system \u2014adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry\u2014one of the many variations of green is identified as 2.5G 5/24."
