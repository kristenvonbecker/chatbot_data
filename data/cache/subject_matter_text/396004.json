  " codependency , a psychological syndrome noted in partners or relatives of persons with alcohol or drug addiction. Not a formal psychiatric diagnosis, codependency has come to be a useful term for discussing aspects of family dysfunction, particularly among participants in recovery groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon.",
  "Codependency refers to an extreme dependency of one person on another who suffers from an addiction. The dependent person\u2019s actions unintentionally help maintain the other person\u2019s addictive behaviour\u2014a phenomenon also referred to as \u201cenabling.\u201d Characteristics of codependent persons include low self-esteem, an unreasonably high need for approval and affection, and denial\u2014both of their own personal needs and of problems within the family. Codependent persons tend to enter relationships that are unstable and that leave them vulnerable to exploitation.",
  "In clinical literature, codependency is said to develop from a person\u2019s childhood attempts to adapt to dysfunctional family life\u2014e.g., life in which parenting is abusive, neglectful, inconsistent, or otherwise seriously ineffective. The development of dependent strategies is one response to such a situation; dependency becomes the child\u2019s way of meeting needs for affection or approval."
