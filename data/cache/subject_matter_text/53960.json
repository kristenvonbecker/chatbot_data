  " equation of motion , mathematical formula that describes the position, velocity, or acceleration of a body relative to a given frame of reference. Newton\u2019s second law, which states that the force F acting on a body is equal to the mass m of the body multiplied by the acceleration a of its centre of mass, F = ma, is the basic equation of motion in classical mechanics. If the force acting on a body is known as a function of time, the velocity and position of the body as functions of time can, theoretically, be derived from Newton\u2019s equation by a process known as integration. For example, a falling body accelerates at a constant rate, g . Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, so that by integration the velocity v in terms of time t is given by v = gt . Velocity is the time rate of change of position S, and, consequently, integration of the velocity equation yields S =  1  2   gt  2 .",
  "If the force acting on a body is specified as a function of position or velocity, the integration of Newton\u2019s equation may be more difficult. When a body is constrained to move in a specified manner on a fixed path, it may be possible to derive the position-time equation; from this equation the velocity-time and acceleration-time equations can, theoretically, be obtained by a process known as differentiation."
