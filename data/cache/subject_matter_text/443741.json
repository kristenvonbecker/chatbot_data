  " After Dark , series of interactive screensaver software created by the American software company Berkeley Systems from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The series later developed into a collection of games and gained a large cult following.",
  "The original After Dark software allowed users to apply interesting and engaging screensavers, ranging from animated bagels to Looney Tunes cartoon characters. Many of the screensavers released through After Dark were linked by a common character, pattern, or theme. Later products provided screensavers that doubled as electronic games .",
  "The most recognizable symbol of After Dark is the \u201cflying toaster,\u201d which appeared in numerous popular culture references in the early 1990s. The flying toaster software also included music, namely \u201cRide of the Valkyries\u201d by German composer Richard Wagner . The winged appliances generated several software releases, and they live on today by virtue of dedicated fans who have worked to update the toasters for new operating systems .",
  "Although After Dark is remembered today for its whimsical qualities, it did have moments of controversy. In 1993 the Delrina Corporation put out a competing screensaver in which the animated characters from the Opus N\u2019 Bill cartoon strip blasted flying toasters out of the sky in an After Dark parody. After a lawsuit was filed by Berkeley, Delrina changed the wings on their toasters to propellers. In a turnabout in 1994, the American psychedelic rock band Jefferson Airplane sued After Dark, claiming the flying toaster was copied from their 1973 Thirty Seconds over Winterland album cover. Similar as the two designs were, Jefferson Airplane had not registered the trademark early enough, and the lawsuit was dismissed."
