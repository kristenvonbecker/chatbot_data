  "   surface tension ,  property of a liquid surface displayed by its acting as if it were a stretched elastic membrane. This phenomenon can be observed in the nearly spherical shape of small drops of liquids and of soap bubbles. Because of this property, certain insects can stand on the surface of water . A razor blade also can be supported by the surface tension of water. The razor blade is not floating: if pushed through the surface, it sinks through the water.",
  "Surface tension depends mainly upon the forces of attraction between the particles within the given liquid and also upon the gas , solid , or liquid in contact with it. The molecules in a drop of water, for example, attract each other weakly. Water molecules well inside the drop may be thought of as being attracted equally in all directions by the surrounding molecules. However, if surface molecules could be displaced slightly outward from the surface, they would be attracted back by the nearby molecules. The energy responsible for the phenomenon of surface tension may be thought of as approximately equivalent to the work or energy required to remove the surface layer of molecules in a unit area. Surface tension may be expressed, therefore, in units of energy ( joules ) per unit area (square metres). Water has a surface tension of 0.07275 joule per square metre at 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). In comparison, organic liquids, such as benzene and alcohols , have lower surface tensions, whereas mercury has a higher surface tension. An increase in temperature lowers the net force of attraction among molecules and hence decreases surface tension.",
  "Surface tension is also viewed as the result of forces acting in the plane of the surface and tending to minimize its area. On this basis, surface tension is often expressed as an amount of force exerted in the surface perpendicular to a line of unit length. The unit then is newtons per metre, which is equivalent to joules per square metre."
