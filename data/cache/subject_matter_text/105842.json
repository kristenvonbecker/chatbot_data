  " engineering , the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind. The field has been defined by the Engineers Council for Professional Development, in the United States, as the creative application of \u201cscientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.\u201d The term engineering is sometimes more loosely defined, especially in Great Britain, as the manufacture or assembly of engines, machine tools, and machine parts.",
  "The words engine and ingenious are derived from the same Latin root, ingenerare , which means \u201cto create.\u201d The early English verb engine meant \u201cto contrive.\u201d Thus, the engines of war were devices such as catapults , floating bridges, and assault towers; their designer was the \u201cengine-er,\u201d or military engineer. The counterpart of the military engineer was the civil engineer , who applied essentially the same knowledge and skills to designing buildings, streets, water supplies, sewage systems, and other projects.",
  "Associated with engineering is a great body of special knowledge; preparation for professional practice involves extensive training in the application of that knowledge. Standards of engineering practice are maintained through the efforts of professional societies, usually organized on a national or regional basis, with all members acknowledging a responsibility to the public over and above responsibilities to their employers or to other members of their society.",
  "The function of the scientist is to know, while that of the engineer is to do. Scientists add to the store of verified systematized knowledge of the physical world, and engineers bring this knowledge to bear on practical problems. Engineering is based principally on physics , chemistry , and mathematics and their extensions into materials science , solid and fluid mechanics , thermodynamics , transfer and rate processes, and systems analysis .",
  "Unlike scientists, engineers are not free to select the problems that interest them. They must solve problems as they arise, and their solutions must satisfy conflicting requirements. Usually, efficiency costs money, safety adds to complexity, and improved performance increases weight. The engineering solution is the optimum solution, the end result that, taking many factors into account, is most desirable. It may be the most reliable within a given weight limit, the simplest that will satisfy certain safety requirements, or the most efficient for a given cost. In many engineering problems the social and environmental costs are significant.",
  "Engineers employ two types of natural resources\u2014materials and energy. Materials are useful because of their properties: their strength, ease of fabrication, lightness, or durability; their ability to insulate or conduct; their chemical, electrical, or acoustical properties. Important sources of energy include fossil fuels ( coal , petroleum , natural gas ), wind , sunlight , falling water , and nuclear fission . Since most resources are limited, engineers must concern themselves with the continual development of new resources as well as the efficient utilization of existing ones.",
  "  The first engineer known by name and achievement is Imhotep , builder of the Step Pyramid at \u1e62aqq\u0101rah, Egypt, probably about 2550 bce . Imhotep\u2019s successors\u2014Egyptian, Persian, Greek, and Roman\u2014carried civil engineering to remarkable heights on the basis of empirical methods aided by arithmetic, geometry, and a smattering of physical science. The Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria , Solomon\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem, the Colosseum in Rome, the Persian and Roman road systems, the Pont du Gard aqueduct in France, and many other large structures, some of which endure to this day, testify to their skill, imagination, and daring. Of many treatises written by them, one in particular survives to provide a picture of engineering education and practice in classical times: Vitruvius \u2019s De architectura , published in Rome in the 1st century ce , a 10-volume work covering building materials, construction methods, hydraulics, measurement, and town planning.",
  "In construction, medieval European engineers carried technique, in the form of the Gothic arch and flying buttress , to a height unknown to the Romans. The sketchbook of the 13th-century French engineer Villard de Honnecourt reveals a wide knowledge of mathematics, geometry, natural and physical science, and draftsmanship.",
  "In Asia, engineering had a separate but very similar development, with more and more sophisticated techniques of construction, hydraulics , and metallurgy helping to create advanced civilizations such as the Mongol empire , whose large, beautiful cities impressed Marco Polo in the 13th century.",
  " Civil engineering emerged as a separate discipline in the 18th century, when the first professional societies and schools of engineering were founded. Civil engineers of the 19th century built structures of all kinds, designed water-supply and sanitation systems, laid out railroad and highway networks, and planned cities. England and Scotland were the birthplace of mechanical engineering , as a derivation of the inventions of the Scottish engineer James Watt and the textile machinists of the Industrial Revolution . The development of the British machine-tool industry gave tremendous impetus to the study of mechanical engineering both in Britain and abroad.",
  "  The growth of knowledge of electricity \u2014from Alessandro Volta \u2019s original electric cell of 1800 through the experiments of Michael Faraday and others, culminating in 1872 in the Gramme dynamo and electric motor (named after the Belgian Z\u00e9nobe-Th\u00e9ophile Gramme )\u2014led to the development of electrical and electronics engineering. The electronics aspect became prominent through the work of such scientists as James Clerk Maxwell of Britain and Heinrich Hertz of Germany in the late 19th century. Major advances came with the development of the vacuum tube by Lee de Forest of the United States in the early 20th century and the invention of the transistor in the mid-20th century. In the late 20th century electrical and electronics engineers outnumbered all others in the world.",
  " Chemical engineering grew out of the 19th-century proliferation of industrial processes involving chemical reactions in metallurgy, food, textiles, and many other areas. By 1880 the use of chemicals in manufacturing had created an industry whose function was the mass production of chemicals. The design and operation of the plants of this industry became a function of the chemical engineer.",
  "In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the field of environmental engineering expanded to address global warming and sustainability. The development and deployment of renewable energy , such as solar and wind power , the creation of new technologies for carbon sequestration and pollution control , and the design of green architecture and environmentally friendly urban planning are all recent developments.",
  "Problem solving is common to all engineering work. The problem may involve quantitative or qualitative factors; it may be physical or economic; it may require abstract mathematics or common sense. Of great importance is the process of creative synthesis or design, putting ideas together to create a new and optimum solution.",
  "Although engineering problems vary in scope and complexity, the same general approach is applicable. First comes an analysis of the situation and a preliminary decision on a plan of attack. In line with this plan, the problem is reduced to a more categorical question that can be clearly stated. The stated question is then answered by deductive reasoning from known principles or by creative synthesis, as in a new design. The answer or design is always checked for accuracy and adequacy. Finally, the results for the simplified problem are interpreted in terms of the original problem and reported in an appropriate form.",
  "In order of decreasing emphasis on science, the major functions of all engineering branches are the following:",

Brocklehurst , A History of Engineering (1925); Richard Shelton Kirby  et al.,  Engineering in History (1956, reprinted 1990); James K. Finch , The Story of Engineering (1960); Donald Hill , A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times (1984); and E.
