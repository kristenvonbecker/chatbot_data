[
  " spin , in physics, the amount of angular momentum associated with a subatomic particle or nucleus and measured in multiples of a unit called the Dirac h, or h -bar (\u210f), equal to the Planck constant divided by 2\u03c0. For electrons, neutrons, and protons, the multiple is 0.5; pions have zero spin. The total angular momentum of nuclei more complex than the proton is the vector sum of the orbital angular momenta and intrinsic spins of the constituent nucleons. For nuclei of even mass number, the multiple is an integer; for those of odd mass number, the multiple is a half-integer. All nuclei with even numbers of neutrons and protons have spin zero in their ground states."
