  " pulse , rhythmic dilation of an artery generated by the opening and closing of the aortic valve in the heart . A pulse can be felt by applying firm fingertip pressure to the skin at sites where the arteries travel near the skin\u2019s surface; it is more evident when surrounding muscles are relaxed. Common pulse points include the carotid artery of the neck, the brachial artery inside the elbow, and the radial artery in the wrist.",
  "The association of pulse with the action of the heart was recognized by the ancient Egyptians, and it remains a valuable indicator of cardiac function in modern medicine. Pulse rate, strength, and rhythm all provide valuable diagnostic information; for example, the regular alteration between strong and weak pulses can indicate heart failure . A rapid pulse may indicate serious cardiac disease , a relatively innocuous fever, or simply vigorous exercise; a slow pulse may be a result of head injury, but it is also normal in highly trained athletes with exceptional heart function.",
  "Pulse rates vary from person to person. The normal pulse rate of an adult at rest may range from 50 to 85 beats per minute, although the average rate is about 70 to 72 for men and 78 to 82 for women. In infants the rate ranges from 110 to 140; the rate decreases with age, and the rate for adolescents is 80 to 90; the normal rate for the elderly may be 50 to 70."
