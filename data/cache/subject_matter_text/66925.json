[
  " settlement , in law, a compromise or agreement between litigants to settle the matters in dispute between them in order to dispose of and conclude their litigation. Generally, as a result of the settlement, prosecution of the action is withdrawn or dismissed without any judgment being entered ( see  nolle prosequi ). In such cases, the settlement itself, as a binding contract between parties, prevents renewal of the litigation. But the parties may, and often do, incorporate the terms of the settlement into a consent judgment, recorded by the court. Such a judgment may afford the same protection against a reopening of the dispute in litigation as is provided by a court judgment at the conclusion of a fully litigated case.",
  "Settlements commonly provide for, or are construed to allow, either party to enforce their terms or to ignore them and reopen the underlying dispute if the other party fails to fulfill the terms and conditions agreed upon. Because, in modern litigation, most suits brought are either withdrawn or settled, the settlement constitutes an important feature of the process.",
  "The term settlement is also applied to a disposition of property to be held in trust."
