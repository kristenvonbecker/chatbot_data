  " snake-eyed skink , any of about 35 species of lizards constituting two genera ( Ablepharus and Cryptoblepharus ) in the family Scincidae. Snake-eyed skinks lack eyelids and have transparent scales (spectacles) covering the eyes similar to those of snakes . Although the function of the spectacle remains unknown, it likely reduces water loss by evaporation from the head region. Spectacles in these two skink genera evolved independently and thus represent an example of convergent evolution . The spectacle is derived from the lower eyelid, which is fused to scales above the eye.",
  "Members of the genus Ablepharus , often referred to as ocellated skinks, range from southeastern Europe to Pakistan. They have elongate bodies, long tails, and small limbs. They live within leaf litter or under rocks, twigs, or low vegetation. Members of the genus Cryptoblepharus are slender with long tails but with well-developed limbs. They occur in southeast Africa, Australia, the Indo-Pacific Islands and have been introduced to so many places that they may have the widest geographic distribution of any lizard genus."
