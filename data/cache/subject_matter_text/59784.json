  " phosphorous acid (H 3 PO 3 ) , also called orthophosphorous acid , one of several oxygen acids of phosphorus, used as reducing agent in chemical analysis. It is a colourless or yellowish crystalline substance (melting point about 73\u00b0 C, or 163\u00b0 F) with a garliclike taste. An unstable compound that readily absorbs moisture, it is converted to phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ) in the presence of oxygen or when heated above 180 \u00b0C (360 \u00b0F). Phosphorous acid (H 3 PO 3 ) forms salts called phosphites, also used as reducing agents. It is prepared by dissolving tetraphosphorus hexoxide (P 4 O 6 ) or phosphorus trichloride (PCl 3 ) in water."
