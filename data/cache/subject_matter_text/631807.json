  "  black , in physics , what is perceived with the human eye when light is absent or when all wavelengths in the visible spectrum are absorbed. Like white , but unlike the colours of the spectrum or most mixtures of them, black lacks hue, so it is considered an achromatic colour .",
  "   Black and white are the most basic colour terms of languages. The word black derives from Proto-Germanic blakaz and Old English bl\u00e6c . One of the first written records of the term is from an Old English translation ( c. 890 ce ) of St. Bede the Venerable \u2019s Historia ecclesiastica : \u201cHe h\u00e6fde bl\u00e6c feax\u201d (\u201cHe had black hair\u201d).",
  "  Pigments for black come from carbon, especially that obtained from burnt vines or bones, or from artificial chemical compounds. Traditional black ink from China, often called India ink , is usually made from soot mixed with animal glue; it is highly prized for its durability and opacity.",
  "In addition to the gray scale, various colour systems have been used to classify black. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner\u2019s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint \u201cRaven Black\u201d is compared to the \u201cBerry of Deadly Night-Shade\u201d and \u201cOliven Ore.\u201d In the Munsell colour system \u2014adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry\u2014absolute black has a value of 0."
