  " angiogenesis inhibitor , also called antiangiogenic agent , substance that blocks the formation of new blood vessels , a process known as angiogenesis . In cancer the progression of tumour development requires the growth of capillaries that supply tumour cells with oxygen and nutrients, and interfering with this essential step is a promising therapeutic approach.",
  "Antiangiogenic drugs have been shown in animal studies to shrink tumours by destroying the capillaries that surround them and by preventing the production of new vessels. An angiogenesis inhibitor called bevacizumab (Avastin) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer . Bevacizumab works by binding to and inhibiting the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which normally stimulates angiogenesis. However, bevacizumab is not effective when administered alone and therefore is given in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents used to treat colorectal cancer, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan. Angiogenesis inhibitors remain an object of intensive research"
