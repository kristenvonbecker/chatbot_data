  " cluster of galaxies , Gravitationally bound grouping of galaxies , numbering from the hundreds to the tens of thousands. Large clusters of galaxies often exhibit extensive X-ray emission from intergalactic gas heated to tens of millions of degrees. Also, interactions of galaxies with each other and with the intracluster gas may deplete galaxies of their own interstellar gas. The Milky Way Galaxy belongs to the Local Group , which lies on the outskirts of the Virgo Cluster ."
