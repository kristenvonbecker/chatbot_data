  " Tanglewood Tales for Girls and Boys , collection of children\u2019s stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne , published in 1853. The book comprises six Greek myths that Hawthorne bowdlerized.",
  "Written as a sequel to A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys (1851), Tanglewood Tales is more serious than its lighthearted predecessor. The tales are \u201cThe Minotaur,\u201d \u201cThe Pygmies,\u201d \u201cThe Dragon\u2019s Teeth,\u201d \u201cCirce\u2019s Palace,\u201d \u201cThe Pomegranate Seeds,\u201d and \u201cThe Golden Fleece.\u201d Because Hawthorne considered the original myths to be impure and inappropriate for his readership, he altered such stories as the seduction of Ariadne by Theseus and the abduction of Persephone by Pluto ."
