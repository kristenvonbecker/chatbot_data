  " dimension , in common parlance, the measure of the size of an object, such as a box, usually given as length, width, and height. In mathematics, the notion of dimension is an extension of the idea that a line is one-dimensional, a plane is two-dimensional, and space is three-dimensional. In mathematics and physics one also considers higher-dimensional spaces, such as four-dimensional space-time, where four numbers are needed to characterize a point: three to fix a point in space and one to fix the time. Infinite-dimensional spaces, first studied early in the 20th century, have played an increasingly important role both in mathematics and in parts of physics such as quantum field theory , where they represent the space of possible states of a quantum mechanical system.",
  "In differential geometry one considers curves as one-dimensional, since a single number, or parameter, determines a point on a curve\u2014for example, the distance, plus or minus, from a fixed point on the curve. A surface, such as the surface of the Earth, has two dimensions, since each point can be located by a pair of numbers\u2014usually latitude and longitude. Higher-dimensional curved spaces were introduced by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann in 1854 and have become both a major subject of study within mathematics and a basic component of modern physics, from Albert Einstein \u2019s theory of general relativity and the subsequent development of cosmological models of the universe to late-20th-century superstring theory .",
  "In 1918 the German mathematician Felix Hausdorff introduced the notion of fractional dimension. This concept has proved extremely fruitful, especially in the hands of the Polish-French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who coined the word  fractal  and showed how fractional dimensions could be useful in many parts of applied mathematics."
