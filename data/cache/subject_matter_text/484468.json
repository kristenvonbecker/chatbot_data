  "Powell found inspiration for the title and form of his opus in Nicolas Poussin \u2019s painting A Dance to the Music of Time , which depicts the Four Seasons dancing to music played by Father Time. The novels focus on social behaviour; all characters are dealt with objectively, as they would wish to appear to outside observers. Personality and motivation are revealed through minute and subtle analysis of disconnected incidents. Nicholas Jenkins, a nonparticipant who is secure in his own values, narrates much of the action of the characters, who are obsessed with power, style, creativity, and public image."
