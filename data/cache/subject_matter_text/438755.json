  "The history of the Milwaukee Art Museum dates to the 1880s, although the museum officially originated when the Milwaukee Art Association and the Layton Art Gallery merged their collections in the late 1950s, becoming the Milwaukee Art Center; it changed its name to the Milwaukee Art Museum in 1980. Located on the shores of Lake Michigan , MAM is a structural landmark both on the shoreline and in the city. It comprises three buildings, each designed in the postmodern tradition by a well-known architect: the\u00a0War Memorial Center (1957) by Eero Saarinen , the Kahler building (1975) by David Kahler, and the Quadracci Pavilion (2001) by Santiago Calatrava . The latter features a moveable brise soleil , or sunscreen, with a 217-foot (66-metre) span. In 2015 the museum completed a total renovation of its buildings.",
