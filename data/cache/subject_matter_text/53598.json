Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune have 1, 2, 92, 83, 27, and 14 moons, respectively. Other bodies in the solar system, such as dwarf planets , asteroids , and Kuiper belt objects, also have moons. No moons have yet been discovered around extrasolar planets . The solar system\u2019s moons range in size from tens of metres across, the diameter of small bodies in orbit around asteroids, to 5,262 km (3,270 miles), the diameter of Jupiter\u2019s moon Ganymede .",
  "  Some moons are of interest because they have conditions that may be favourable for life . For example, Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa has an ocean underneath its icy surface. Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus has geysers that spew out water and organic molecules .",
  "During nine Apollo space missions, 24 astronauts (all Americans) went to Earth\u2019s Moon , and 12 of them walked on its surface. With the launch of the Artemis space program in 2017, NASA aims to return humans to the Moon by 2025, with the goal of establishing a sustainable presence there and on other planets."
