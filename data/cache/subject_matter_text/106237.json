  "  Tasmanian Wilderness , area of remarkable natural beauty and ecological diversity in southwestern, western, and central Tasmania , Australia . Designated a World Heritage site in 1982, its area was extended to some 5,300 square miles (13,800 square km) in 1989.",
  "  The Tasmanian Wilderness consists largely of Southwest National Park (established 1968), Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park (1981), and Cradle Mountain\u2013Lake St. Clair National Park (1971), but it also includes the national parks Walls of Jerusalem (1981) and Hartz Mountains (1939). On its northeastern and eastern edges are the Central Plateau Conservation Area (1982) and other protected lands. Archaeological sites within the region are Maxwell River and Wargata Mina, and there is a historic site at Macquarie Harbour .",
  "Tens of thousands of years after the arrival of Aborigines to the area, it became the home of Tasmania\u2019s first penal colony (1822\u201333), which centred on Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour. Trapping, mining, shipbuilding, and the harvest of timber were important economic activities from the early 19th century, and industrial interests still compete for a share of the region\u2019s natural wealth.",
  "  Both alpine vegetation and cool temperate rainforests characterize the scenic landscape, which supports Tasmanian devils , spotted-tail and eastern quolls ( native cats ), burrowing crayfish, and endemic tree frogs, cave spiders, and long-tailed mice. Broad-toothed rats and ground parrots are also found. Notable tree species include the native plum, sedge, eucalyptus, and leatherwood, as well as the endemic scoparia, myrtle beech, Huon pine, and King Billy pine."
