[
  " spinning , In metalwork , a technique for making hollow metal utensils and artifacts. Developed in the 19th century, the method can be used for most metals. A metal disk is set on a lathe behind an appropriately shaped metal or wooden chuck; while the lathe is rotating, the metal is pressed onto the chuck with a tool. A typical modern spun object is the aluminum saucepan. As in most metalworking techniques, the metal is periodically softened by annealing , or heating, when it has become hardened by being worked ( see hardening)."
