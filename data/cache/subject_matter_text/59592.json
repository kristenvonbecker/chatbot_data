  "  phase , in astronomy , any of the varying appearances of a celestial body as different amounts of its disk are seen (from Earth , ordinarily) to be illuminated by the Sun . The Moon displays eight phases: new, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent. New moon occurs when the Moon is between Earth and the Sun, and thus the side of the Moon that is in shadow faces Earth. Full moon occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, and thus the side of the Moon that is illuminated faces Earth. First and last quarter, in which half the Moon appears illuminated, occur when the Moon is at a right angle with respect to the Sun when viewed from Earth. The waxing and waning crescent phases occur when about one-fourth of the Moon is illuminated, and the waxing and waning gibbous phases occur when about three-fourths of the Moon is illuminated. Earth, as seen from the Moon, shows the same phases in opposite order; e.g., Earth is full when the Moon is new.",
  " Planets more distant than Earth from the Sun display only full or gibbous (more than half but not entirely full) phases to an observer on Earth; i.e., they are always seen with more than half of their apparent disks in sunlight. However, only Mars is noticeably gibbous. The two planets closer to the Sun than Earth, Mercury and Venus , show full cycles of phases like the Moon\u2019s. The Italian astronomer Galileo \u2019s discovery of the phases of Venus was the first direct observational evidence for the Sun-centred (or heliocentric ) solar system . In 2009 the Kepler satellite detected the first phases of an extrasolar planet , HAT-P-7, as it orbited its star ."
