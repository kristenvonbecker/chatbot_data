  " Muriel Rukeyser , (born December 15, 1913, New York, New York, U.S.\u2014died February 12, 1980, New York City), American poet whose work focused on social and political problems.",
  "Rukeyser attended private schools and in 1930\u201332 was a student at Vassar College. During that time she contributed poems to Poetry magazine and other periodicals. She worked on the staff of the Student Review in 1932\u201333 and later edited the Housatonic , a literary journal. In 1935 her first volume of poems appeared as Theory of Flight in the Yale Younger Poets series. Rukeyser\u2019s travels over the next few years provided material for the poems in Mediterranean (1938), U.S. 1 (1938), and A Turning Wind (1939). Her use of fragmented, emotional imagery is sometimes considered excessive, but her work is noted for its power and acuity. In 1942 she published Willard Gibbs: American Genius , a biography of the 19th-century mathematician and physicist.",
  "She supported herself by lecturing and working in film. In addition to several more volumes of poetry, Rukeyser wrote the prose work The Life of Poetry (1949) and several books for children. She also produced another biography, The Traces of Thomas Hariot (1971), and published translations of Octavio Paz ( Selected Poems of Octavio Paz , 1963), Gunnar Ekel\u00f6f ( Selected Poems of Gunnar Ekel\u00f6f , 1967; with Leif Sj\u00f6ber), and Bertolt Brecht ( Uncle Eddie\u2019s Moustache , 1974). Her last volume of poetry, The Collected Poems , was published in 1978.",
  "From 1956 to 1967 Rukeyser taught at Sarah Lawrence College. Having taken up the cause of Spanish loyalists during the Spanish Civil War, she remained politically active in her later years."
