  " Allium cepa  bulb , in botany , a modified stem that is the resting stage of certain seed plants, particularly perennial monocotyledons . A bulb consists of a relatively large, usually globe-shaped, underground bud with membraneous or fleshy overlapping leaves arising from a short stem. A bulb\u2019s fleshy leaves\u2014which in some species are actually expanded leaf bases\u2014function as food reserves that enable a plant to lie dormant when water is unavailable (during winter or drought) and resume its active growth when favourable conditions again prevail.",
  "  There are two main types of bulbs. One type, typified by the onion , has a thin papery covering protecting its fleshy leaves. The other type, the scaly bulb, as seen in true lilies , has naked storage leaves, unprotected by any papery covering, that make the bulb appear to consist of a series of angular scales. Bulbs can vary in size from insignificant pea-sized structures to those of large crinum lilies ( Crinum species), the individual bulbs of which may weigh more than 7 kg (15 pounds).",
  " Hyancinthus  Bulbs enable many common garden ornamentals, such as the narcissus , tulip , and hyacinth , to produce their flowers rapidly, almost precociously, in early spring when growing conditions are favourable. Other bulb-producing plants, such as the lilies , flower in the summer, while a few, such as the meadow saffron, bloom in the fall. Bulb-producing species are especially abundant in the lily ( Liliaceae ) and amaryllis ( Amaryllidaceae ) families. A few bulb-producing species are of economic importance to humans because of the taste and nutritive value of their fleshy leaves; included among such species are the onion and its relatives the shallot , garlic , and leek . Other bulbs contain poisonous compounds\u2014such as the red squill ( Drimia ), the bulbs of which are the source of a highly effective rat poison .",
  "In horticulture the term bulb is incorrectly applied to a number of botanical structures that have a similar food-storing function. Among these are the solid corms of the crocus and gladiolus and the elongated rhizome of some irises ."
