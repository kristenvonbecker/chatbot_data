  " Mark Aldanov , pseudonym of Mark Aleksandrovich Landau , (born Oct. 26 [Nov. 7, New Style], 1889, Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empire\u2014died Feb. 25, 1957, Nice, France), Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer best known for work bitterly critical of the Soviet system.",
  "In 1919 Aldanov emigrated to France, which he left for the United States in 1941, although six years later he returned to France. He wrote an essay on Lenin (1921); Deux r\u00e9volutions (1921; \u201cTwo Revolutions\u201d), a work comparing the Russian and French revolutions; Actinochimie (1936; \u201cActinic Chemistry\u201d), a scientific treatise; and many novels. Most of Aldanov\u2019s works were translated into English, including a tetralogy on revolutionary France, Myslitel (1923\u201325; The Thinker ); an anti-Soviet satire, Nachalo kontsa (1939; The Fifth Seal ); and Istoki (1947; Before the Deluge ), a picture of Europe in the 1870s.",
  "Aldanov enjoyed a reputation of great moral authority among Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. He was one of the founders in New York City of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 journal Novy Zhurnal (\u201cThe New Magazine\u201d). Aldanov\u2019s works and materials from his archives were published during the glasnost years in the six-volume Sobraniye sochineny (1991\u201393; \u201cCollected Works\u201d). By the late 1990s, however, Aldanov\u2019s popularity had diminished as the political significance of his work faded."
