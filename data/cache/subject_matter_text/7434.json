  " Andersen\u2019s disease , also called Glycogenosis Type Iv , extremely rare hereditary metabolic disorder produced by absence of the enzyme amylo-1:4,1:6-transglucosidase, which is an essential mediator of the synthesis of glycogen. An abnormal form of glycogen, amylopectin, is produced and accumulates in body tissues, particularly in the liver and heart. Affected children appear normal at birth but fail to thrive and later lose muscle tone, becoming lethargic. The liver and spleen become enlarged, and progressive liver failure occurs prior to death, usually before age three, caused by heart failure or bleeding from the esophagus. Liver transplants have proved successful in treating the disorder. Donated livers are often able to produce enough of the enzymes necessary to stop the accumulations of abnormal glycogen. Andersen\u2019s disease is transmitted as an autosomal-recessive trait, as are most similar enzyme defects."
