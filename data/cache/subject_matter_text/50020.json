  " magnetic-core memory , also called core memory or magnetic-core storage , any of a class of computer memory devices consisting of a large array of tiny toruses of a hard magnetic material that can be magnetized in either of two directions. The two directions can represent either of the values, 0 or 1, in a binary  bit . Magnetic-core memory entered widespread use in the 1950s and was supplanted by semiconductor memory chips in the 1970s."
