  " negative capability , a writer\u2019s ability, \u201cwhich Shakespeare possessed so enormously,\u201d to accept \u201cuncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason,\u201d according to English poet John Keats , who first used the term in an 1817 letter. An author possessing negative capability is objective and emotionally detached, as opposed to one who writes for didactic purposes; a literary work possessing negative capability may have beauties and depths that make conventional considerations of truth and morality irrelevant."
