  " Frogs , Greek Batrachoi , a literary comedy by Aristophanes , produced in 405 bce . The play tells the story of Dionysus , the god of drama, who is mourning the quality of present-day tragedy in Athens after the death of his recent favourite, Euripides . Disguising himself as the hero Heracles , Dionysus goes down to Hades to bring Euripides back to the land of the living. A competition between Euripides and his predecessor, Aeschylus , however, convinces Dionysus that Aeschylus is the writer more likely to help Athens in its troubles, and, leaving Euripides behind, Dionysus returns to earth with Aeschylus."
