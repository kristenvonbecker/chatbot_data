  "  sand ,  mineral , rock , or soil particles that range in diameter from 0.02 to 2 mm (0.0008\u20130.08 inch). Most of the rock-forming minerals that occur on the Earth\u2019s surface are found in sand, but only a limited number are common in this form. Although in some localities feldspar , calcareous material, iron  ores , and volcanic glass are dominant constituents of sand, quartz is by far the commonest, for several reasons: it is abundant in rocks, is comparatively hard, has practically no cleavage so that it is not readily worn down, is nearly insoluble in water , and does not decompose. Most quartzose sands contain a small quantity of feldspar, as well as small plates of white mica , which, though soft, decompose slowly.",
  "All sands contain small quantities of heavy rock-forming minerals, including garnet , tourmaline , zircon , rutile , topaz , pyroxenes , and amphiboles . In some shore and river sands these heavier constituents, as well as some of the heavy native elements, become concentrated as a result of sorting by currents and the removal of the lighter constituents. Such placer sands may be economically valuable deposits worked for diamonds and other gemstones, gold , platinum , tin , monazite , and other ores. Greensands, widely distributed over the floor of the ocean and found in ancient strata on the continents , owe their colour to the presence of glauconite , a potash -bearing mineral; these sands are used for water softeners .",
  "In the pottery and glassmaking industries very pure quartzose sands are used as a source of silica . Similar sands are required for lining the hearths of acid-steel furnaces . Molds used in foundries for casting  metal are made of sand with a clay  binder . Quartz and garnet sands are used extensively as abrasives . Ordinary sands find a multitude of other uses\u2014e.g., in the preparation of mortar , cement , and concrete ."
