  " mortar , in technology, material used in building construction to bond brick, stone, tile, or concrete blocks into a structure. Mortar consists of inert siliceous (sandy) material mixed with cement and water in such proportions that the resulting substance will be sufficiently plastic to enable ready application with the mason\u2019s trowel and to flow slightly but not collapse under the weight of the masonry units. Slaked lime is often added to promote smoothness, and sometimes colouring agents are also added. Cement is the most costly ingredient and is held to the minimum consistent with desired strength and watertightness.",
  "Mortar hardens into a stonelike mass and, properly applied, distributes the load of the structure uniformly over the bonding surfaces and provides a weathertight joint."
