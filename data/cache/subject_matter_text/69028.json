  "  specific gravity , also called relative density , ratio of the density of a substance to that of a standard substance.",
  "The usual standard of comparison for solids and liquids is water at 4 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F), which has a density of 1.0 kg per litre (62.4 pounds per cubic foot). Gases are commonly compared with dry air , which has a density of 1.29 grams per litre (1.29 ounces per cubic foot) under so-called standard conditions (0 \u00b0C and a pressure of 1 standard atmosphere ). For example, liquid mercury has a density of 13.6 kg per litre; therefore, its specific gravity is 13.6. The gas carbon dioxide , which has a density of 1.976 grams per litre under standard conditions, has a specific gravity of 1.53 (= 1.976/1.29). Because it is the ratio of two quantities that have the same dimensions (mass per unit volume), specific gravity has no dimension.",
  "Buoyancy (the ability of an object to float in water or air) is intimately related to specific gravity. If a substance has specific gravity less than that of a fluid , it will float on that fluid: helium -filled balloons will rise in air, oil will form a slick on water, and lead will float on mercury. The specific gravity of a substance is characteristic; it is the same for different samples of a substance (if pure, the same in composition, and free from cavities or inclusions) and is used to help identify unknown substances. Specific gravity has many other applications: gemologists use it to distinguish similar gems ; chemists, to check on the progress of reactions and the concentration of solutions; and auto mechanics, to test battery fluid and antifreeze .",
  "Specific gravity is the basis of methods used throughout history to concentrate ores . Panning, jigging, shaking, spiral separation, and heavy-medium separation are among the methods that depend on differences in specific gravity to obtain concentrated ore. Specific gravity is highest in rocks rich in iron , magnesium  oxide , and the heavy metals and lowest in those rich in alkalies , silica , and water.",
  "The ease with which specific gravity can be precisely determined leads to its widespread use in chemical science and technology; for example, determination of the specific gravity is part of the routine characterization of a new liquid compound. The specific gravity of most organic compounds containing only carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen is less than one. Among the devices used to measure specific gravity are the Westphal balance, the pycnometer, and the hydrometer ."
