As a unit of weight, the ounce derives from the Roman uncia (meaning \u201ctwelfth part\u201d), which was  1  12  of a Roman foot or ounce. The standard or physical embodiment of the Roman foot, a copper bar, constituted the Roman pound standard and was divided along its length into 12 equal parts, called unciae . Thus, uncia designated both a unit of weight and one of length and is the source of the modern terms inch and ounce."
