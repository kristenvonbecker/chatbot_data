  "  universe , the whole cosmic system of matter and energy of which Earth , and therefore the human race, is a part. Humanity has traveled a long road since societies imagined Earth, the Sun , and the Moon as the main objects of creation, with the rest of the universe being formed almost as an afterthought. Today it is known that Earth is only a small ball of rock in a space of unimaginable vastness and that the birth of the solar system was probably only one event among many that occurred against the backdrop of an already mature universe. This humbling lesson has unveiled a remarkable fact, one that endows the minutest particle in the universe with a rich and noble heritage: events that occurred in the first few minutes of the creation of the universe 13.7 billion years ago turn out to have had a profound influence on the birth, life, and death of galaxies , stars , and planets . Indeed, a line can be drawn from the forging of the matter of the universe in a primal \u201c big bang \u201d to the gathering on Earth of atoms versatile enough to serve as the basis of life . The intrinsic harmony of such a worldview has great philosophical and aesthetic appeal, and it may explain why public interest in the universe has always endured.",

For an article about the possible existence of other universes, see  multiverse .",
  "All scientific thinking on the nature of the universe can be traced to the distinctive geometric patterns formed by the stars in the night sky. Even prehistoric people must have noticed that, apart from a daily rotation (which is now understood to arise from the spin of Earth ), the stars did not seem to move with respect to one another: the stars appear \u201cfixed.\u201d Early nomads found that knowledge of the constellations could guide their travels, and they developed stories to help them remember the relative positions of the stars in the night sky. These stories became the mythical tales that are part of most cultures.",
  "When nomads turned to farming, an intimate knowledge of the constellations served a new function\u2014an aid in timekeeping, in particular for keeping track of the seasons . People had noticed very early that certain celestial objects did not remain stationary relative to the \u201cfixed\u201d stars; instead, during the course of a year, they moved forward and backward in a narrow strip of the sky that contained 12 constellations constituting the signs of the zodiac . Seven such wanderers were known to the ancients: the Sun , the Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn . Foremost among the wanderers was the Sun: day and night came with its rising and setting, and its motion through the zodiac signaled the season to plant and the season to reap. Next in importance was the Moon: its position correlated with the tides , and its shape changed intriguingly over the course of a month. The Sun and Moon had the power of gods; why not then the other wanderers? Thus probably arose the astrological belief that the positions of the planets (from the Greek word planetes , \u201cwanderers\u201d) in the zodiac could influence worldly events and even cause the rise and fall of kings. In homage to this belief, Babylonian priests devised the week of seven days, whose names even in various modern languages (for example, English, French, or Norwegian) can still easily be traced to their origins in the seven planet-gods.",
  "  The apex in the description of planetary motions during classical antiquity was reached with the Greeks , who were of course superb geometers . Like their predecessors, Greek astronomers adopted the natural picture, from the point of view of an observer on Earth , that Earth lay motionless at the centre of a rigidly rotating celestial sphere (to which the stars were \u201cfixed\u201d), and that the complex to-and-fro wanderings of the planets in the zodiac were to be described against this unchanging backdrop. They developed an epicyclic model that would reproduce the observed planetary motions with quite astonishing accuracy. The model invoked small circles on top of large circles, all rotating at individual uniform speeds, and it culminated about 140 ce with the work of Ptolemy , who introduced the ingenious artifact of displaced centres for the circles to improve the empirical fit. Although the model was purely kinematic and did not attempt to address the dynamical reasons for why the motions were as they were, it laid the groundwork for the paradigm that nature is not capricious but possesses a regularity and precision that can be discovered from experience and used to predict future events.",
  " l l R R l R  The application of the methods of Euclidean geometry to planetary astronomy by the Greeks led to other schools of thought as well. Pythagoras ( c. 570\u2013 c. 490 bce ), for example, argued that the world could be understood on rational principles (\u201call things are numbers\u201d); that it was made of four elements\u2014earth, water, air, and fire; that Earth was a sphere; and that the Moon shone by reflected light. In the 4th century bce  Heracleides Ponticus , a follower of Pythagoras, taught that the spherical Earth rotated freely in space and that Mercury and Venus revolved about the Sun . From the different lengths of shadows cast in Syene and Alexandria at noon on the first day of summer, Eratosthenes ( c. 276\u2013194 bce ) computed the radius of Earth to an accuracy within 20 percent of the modern value. Starting with the size of Earth\u2019s shadow cast on the Moon during a lunar eclipse , Aristarchus of Samos ( c. 310\u2013230 bce ) calculated the linear size of the Moon relative to Earth. From its measured angular size, he then obtained the distance to the Moon. He also proposed a clever scheme to measure the size and distance of the Sun. Although flawed, the method did enable him to deduce that the Sun is much larger than Earth. This deduction led Aristarchus to speculate that Earth revolves about the Sun rather than the other way around.",
  "Unfortunately, except for the conception that Earth is a sphere (inferred from Earth\u2019s shadow on the Moon always being circular during a lunar eclipse), these ideas failed to gain general acceptance. The precise reasons remain unclear, but the growing separation between the empirical and aesthetic branches of learning must have played a major role. The unparalleled numerical accuracy achieved by the theory of epicyclic motions for planetary motions lent great empirical validity to the Ptolemaic system. Henceforth, such computational matters could be left to practical astronomers without the necessity of having to ascertain the physical reality of the model. Instead, absolute truth was to be sought through the Platonic ideal of pure thought. Even the Pythagoreans fell into this trap; the depths to which they eventually sank may be judged from the story that they discovered and then tried to conceal the fact that the square root of 2 is an irrational number (i.e., cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers ).",
  "  The systematic application of pure reason to the explanation of natural phenomena reached its extreme development with Aristotle (384\u2013322 bce ), whose great system of the world later came to be regarded as the synthesis of all worthwhile knowledge. Aristotle argued that humans could not inhabit a moving and rotating Earth without violating common sense perceptions. Moreover, in his theory of impetus, all terrestrial motion, presumably including that of Earth itself, would grind to a halt without the continued application of force . He took for granted the action of friction because he would not allow the seminal idealization of a body moving through a void (\u201cnature abhors a vacuum\u201d). Thus, Aristotle was misled into equating force with velocity rather than, as Sir Isaac Newton was to show much later, with ( mass times) acceleration . Celestial objects were exempt from dynamical decay because they moved in a higher stratum whereby a perfect sphere was the natural shape of heavenly bodies and uniform rotation in circles was the natural state of their motion. Indeed, primary motion was derived from the outermost sphere, the seat of the unchangeable stars and of divine power. No further explanation was needed beyond the aesthetic one. In this scheme, the imperfect motion of comets had to be postulated as meteorological phenomena that took place within the imperfect atmosphere of Earth.",
  "The great merit of Aristotle\u2019s system was its internal logic, a grand attempt to unify all branches of human knowledge within the scope of a single self-consistent and comprehensive theory. Its great weakness was that its rigid arguments rested almost entirely on aesthetic grounds; it lacked a mechanism by which empirical knowledge gained from experimentation or observation could be used to test, modify, or reject the fundamental principles underlying the theory. Aristotle\u2019s system had the underlying philosophical drive of modern science without its flexible procedure of self-correction that allows the truth to be approached in a series of successive approximations.",
  "With the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 ce , much of what was known to the Greeks was lost or forgotten\u2014at least to Western civilizations. ( Hindu astronomers still taught that Earth was a sphere and that it rotated once daily.) The Aristotelian system, however, resonated with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages , especially in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, and later, during the period of the Counter-Reformation in the 16th and early 17th century, it ascended to the status of religious dogma. Thus did the notion of an Earth-centred universe become gradually enmeshed in the politics of religion. Also welcome in an age that insisted on a literal interpretation of the Scriptures was Aristotle\u2019s view that the living species of Earth were fixed for all time. What was not accepted was Aristotle\u2019s argument on logical grounds that the world was eternal, extending infinitely into the past and the future even though it had finite spatial extent. For the church, there was definitely a creation event, and infinity was reserved for God, not space or time.",
  "  The Renaissance brought a fresh spirit of inquiry to the arts and sciences. Explorers and travelers brought home the vestiges of classical knowledge that had been preserved in the Muslim world and the East, and in the 15th century Aristarchus \u2019 heliocentric hypothesis again came to be debated in certain educated circles. The boldest step was taken by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus , who hesitated for so long in publication that he did not see a printed copy of his own work until he lay on his deathbed in 1543. Copernicus recognized more profoundly than anyone else the advantages of a Sun-centred planetary system . By adopting the view that Earth circled the Sun , he could qualitatively explain the to-and-fro wanderings of the planets much more simply than Ptolemy . For example, at certain times in the motions of Earth and Mars about the Sun, Earth would catch up with Mars\u2019s projected motion, and then that planet would appear to go backward through the zodiac . Unfortunately in his Sun-centred system, Copernicus continued to adhere to the established tradition of using uniform circular motion , and if he adopted only one large circle for the orbit of each planet, his calculated planetary positions would in fact be quantitatively poorer in comparison with the observed positions of the planets than tables based on the Ptolemaic system . This defect could be partially corrected by providing additional smaller circles, but then much of the beauty and simplicity of Copernicus\u2019 original system would be lost. Moreover, though the Sun was now removed from the list of planets and Earth added, the Moon still needed to move around Earth.",
  "It was Galileo who exploited the power of newly invented lenses to build a telescope that would accumulate indirect support for the Copernican viewpoint. Critics had no rational response to Galileo\u2019s discovery of the correlation of Venus \u2019 phases of illumination with its orbital position relative to the Sun, which required it to circle that body rather than Earth. Nor could they refute his discovery of the four brightest satellites of Jupiter (the so-called Galilean satellites), which demonstrated that planets could indeed possess moons . They could only refuse to look through the telescope or refuse to see what their own eyes told them.",
  "  Galileo also mounted a systematic attack on other accepted teachings of Aristotle by showing, for example, that the Sun was not perfect but had spots . Besieged on all sides by what it perceived as heretical stirrings, the church forced Galileo to recant his support of the heliocentric system in 1633. Confined to house arrest during his last years, Galileo would perform actual experiments and thought experiments (summarized in a treatise) that would refute the core of Aristotelian dynamics. Most notably, he formulated the concept that would eventually lead (in the hands of Ren\u00e9 Descartes ) to the so-called first law of mechanics \u2014namely, that a body in motion, freed from friction and from all other forces , would move, not in a circle, but in a straight line at uniform speed. The frame of reference for making such measurements was ultimately the \u201cfixed stars.\u201d Galileo also argued that, in the gravitational field of Earth and in the absence of air drag, bodies of different weights would fall at the same rate. This finding would eventually lead (in the hands of Einstein ) to the principle of equivalence, a cornerstone of the theory of general relativity .",
  "  It was the German astronomer Johannes Kepler , a contemporary of Galileo, who would provide the crucial blow that assured the success of the Copernican revolution. Of all the planets whose orbits Copernicus had tried to explain with a single circle, Mars had the largest departure (the largest eccentricity, in astronomical nomenclature); consequently, Kepler arranged to work with the foremost observational astronomer of his day, Tycho Brahe of Denmark, who had accumulated over many years the most precise positional measurements of this planet. When Kepler finally gained access to the data upon Tycho\u2019s death, he painstakingly tried to fit the observations to one curve after another. The work was especially difficult because he had to assume an orbit for Earth before he could self-consistently subtract the effects of its motion. Finally, after many close calls and rejections, he hit upon a simple, elegant solution\u2014an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. The other planets also fell into place. This triumph was followed by others, notable among which was Kepler\u2019s discovery of his so-called three laws of planetary motion . The empirical victory secure, the stage was set for Newton\u2019s matchless theoretical campaigns.",
  "Two towering achievements paved the way for Newton\u2019s conquest of the dynamical problem of planetary motions: his discoveries of the second law of mechanics and of the law of universal gravitation . The second law of mechanics generalized the work of Galileo and Descartes on terrestrial dynamics, asserting how bodies generally move when they are subjected to external forces. The law of universal gravitation generalized the work of Galileo and the English physicist Robert Hooke on terrestrial gravity, asserting that two massive bodies attract one another with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. By pure mathematical deduction, Newton showed that these two general laws (whose empirical basis rested in the laboratory) implied, when applied to the celestial realm, Kepler\u2019s three laws of planetary motion. This brilliant coup completed the Copernican program to replace the old worldview with an alternative that was far superior, both in conceptual principle and in practical application. In the same stroke of genius, Newton unified the mechanics of heaven and Earth and initiated the era of modern science.",
  "In formulating his laws , Newton asserted as postulates the notions of absolute space (in the sense of Euclidean geometry ) and absolute time (a mathematical quantity that flows in the universe without reference to anything else). A kind of relativity principle did exist (\u201cGalilean relativity\u201d) in the freedom to choose different inertial frames of reference \u2014i.e., the form of Newton\u2019s laws was unaffected by motion at constant velocity with respect to the \u201cfixed stars.\u201d However, Newton\u2019s scheme unambiguously sundered space and time as fundamentally separate entities. This step was necessary for progress to be made, and it was such a wonderfully accurate approximation to the truth for describing motions that are slow compared to the speed of light that it withstood all tests for more than two centuries.",
  "  In 1705 the English astronomer Edmond Halley used Newton\u2019s laws to predict that a certain comet last seen in 1682 would reappear 76 years later. When Halley\u2019s Comet returned on Christmas night 1758, many years after the deaths of both Newton and Halley, no educated person could ever again seriously doubt the power of mechanistic explanations for natural phenomena. Nor would anyone worry again that the unruly excursions of comets through the solar system would smash the crystalline spheres that earlier thinkers had mentally constructed to carry planets and the other celestial bodies through the heavens. The attention of professional astronomers now turned increasingly toward an understanding of the stars.",
  "  In the latter effort, the British astronomer William Herschel and his son John led the assault. The construction of ever more powerful reflecting telescopes allowed them during the late 1700s and early 1800s to measure the angular positions and apparent brightnesses of many faint stars . In an earlier epoch, Galileo had turned his telescope to the Milky Way and saw that it was composed of countless individual stars. Now the Herschels began an ambitious program to gauge quantitatively the distribution of the stars in the sky. On the assumption (first adopted by the Dutch mathematician and scientist Christiaan Huygens ) that faintness is a statistical measure of distance, they inferred the enormous average separations of stars. This view received direct confirmation for the nearest stars through parallax measurements of their distances from Earth . Later, photographs taken over a period of many years also showed that some stars changed locations across the line of sight relative to the background; thus, astronomers learned that stars are not truly fixed, but rather have motions with respect to one another. These real motions \u2014as well as the apparent ones due to parallax, first measured by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel in 1838\u2014were not detected by the ancients because of the enormous distance scale of the stellar universe.",
  "The statistical studies based on these new perceptions continued into the early 20th century. They culminated with the analysis by the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn who, like William Herschel before him, used number counts of stars to study their distribution in space. It can be shown for stars with an arbitrary but fixed mixture of intrinsic brightnesses that\u2014in the absence of absorption of starlight\u2014the number N of stars with apparent brightness, energy flux f , larger than a specified level f  0 , is given by N = A  f  0  \u22123/2 , where A is a constant, if the stars are distributed uniformly in Euclidean space (space satisfying the principles of Euclidean geometry ). The number N would increase with decreasing limiting apparent brightness f  0 , because one is sampling, on average, larger volumes of space when one counts fainter sources. Kapteyn found that the number N increased less rapidly with decreasing f  0 than the hypothetical value A  f  0  \u22123/2 ; this indicated to him that the solar system lay near the centre of a distribution of stars, which thinned in number with increasing distance from the centre. Moreover, Kapteyn determined that the rate of thinning was more rapid in certain directions than in others. This observation, in conjunction with other arguments that set the scale, led him in the first two decades of the 20th century to depict the Milky Way Galaxy (then confused with the entire universe) as a rather small, flattened stratum of stars and gaseous nebulae in which the number of stars decreased to 10 percent of their central value at a distance in the plane of about 8,500 light-years from the galactic centre.",
  "    In 1917 the American astronomer Harlow Shapley mounted a serious challenge to the Kapteyn universe. Shapley\u2019s study of the distances of globular clusters led him to conclude that their distribution centred on a point that lay in the direction of the constellation  Sagittarius and at a distance that he estimated to be about 45,000 light-years (50 percent larger than the modern value). Shapley was able to determine the distance to the globulars through the calibration of the intrinsic brightnesses of some variable stars found in them. (Knowing the period of the light variations allowed Shapley to infer the average intrinsic brightness. A measurement of the average apparent brightness then allowed, from the 1/ r  2 law of brightness, a deduction of the distance r .) According to Shapley, the galactic system was much larger than Kapteyn\u2019s estimate. Moreover, the Sun was located not at its centre but rather at its radial outskirts (though close to the midplane of a flattened disk). Shapley\u2019s dethronement of the Sun from the centre of the stellar system has often been compared with Copernicus \u2019 dethronement of Earth from the centre of the planetary system, but its largest astronomical impact rested with the enormous physical dimensions ascribed to the Galaxy. In 1920 a debate was arranged between Shapley and Heber D. Curtis to discuss this issue before the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.",
  "  The debate also addressed a second controversy\u2014the nature of the so-called spiral nebulas. Shapley and his adherents held that these objects were made up of diffuse gas and were therefore similar to the other gas clouds known within the confines of the Milky Way Galaxy. Curtis and others, by contrast, maintained that the spirals consisted of stars and were thus equivalent to independent galaxies coequal to the Galaxy. A parallel line of thought had been proposed earlier by the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Thomas Wright and by William Herschel . The renewed argument over the status of the spirals grew in part out of an important development that occurred around the turn of the 20th century: the astronomical incorporation of the methods of spectroscopy both to study the physical nature of celestial bodies and to obtain the component of their velocities along the line of sight. By analyzing the properties of spectral lines in the received light (e.g., seeing if the lines were produced by absorption or emission and if the lines were broad or narrow), or by analyzing the gross colours of the observed object, astronomers learned to distinguish between ordinary stars and gaseous nebulas existing in the regions between stars. By measuring the displacement in wavelength of the spectral lines with respect to their laboratory counterparts and assuming the displacement to arise from the Doppler effect , they could deduce the velocity of recession (or approach). The spirals posed interpretative difficulties on all counts: they had spectral properties that were unlike either local collections of stars or gaseous nebulas (because of the unforeseen roles of dust and different populations of stars in the arms, disk, and central bulge of a spiral galaxy); and, as had been shown by the American astronomer Vesto Slipher , they generally possessed recession velocities that were enormous compared to those then known for any other astronomical object.",
  "The formal debate between Shapley and Curtis ended inconclusively, but history has proved Shapley to be mostly right on the issue of the off-centre position of the solar system and the large scale of the Galaxy , and Curtis to be mostly right on the issue of the nature of the spirals as independent galaxies. As demonstrated in the work of the Swiss-born U.S. astronomer Robert J. Trumpler in 1930. Kapteyn (and Herschel) had been misled by the effects of the undiscovered but pervasive interstellar dust to think that the stars in the Milky Way thinned out with distance much more quickly than they actually do. The effect of interstellar dust was much less important for Shapley\u2019s studies because the globular clusters mostly lie well away from the plane of the Milky Way system.",
  "  The decisive piece of evidence concerning the extragalactic nature of the spirals was provided in 1923\u201324 by Edwin Hubble , who succeeded in resolving one field in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) into a collection of distinct stars . Some of the stars proved to be variables of a type similar to those found by Shapley in globular clusters. Measurements of the properties of these variables yielded estimates of their distances. As it turned out, the distance to M31 put it well outside the confines of even Shapley\u2019s huge model of the Galaxy , and M31 therefore must be an independent system of stars (and gas clouds).",
  "  Hubble\u2019s findings inaugurated the era of extragalactic astronomy. He himself went on to classify the morphological types of the different galaxies he found: spirals, ellipticals, and irregulars. In 1926 he showed that, apart from a \u201czone of avoidance\u201d (region characterized by an apparent absence of galaxies near the plane of the Milky Way caused by the obscuration of interstellar dust), the distribution of galaxies in space is close to uniform when averaged over sufficiently large scales, with no observable boundary or edge. The procedure was identical to that used by Kapteyn and Herschel, with galaxies replacing stars as the luminous sources. The difference was that this time the number count N was proportional to f  0  -3/2 , to the limits of the original survey. Hubble\u2019s finding provided the empirical justification for the so-called cosmological principle, a term coined by the English mathematician and astrophysicist Edward A. Milne to describe the assumption that at any instant in time the universe is, in the large, homogeneous and isotropic\u2014i.e., statistically the same in every place and in every direction. This represented the ultimate triumph for the Copernican revolution.",
  "  It was also Hubble who interpreted and quantified Slipher\u2019s results on the large recessional velocities of galaxies\u2014they correspond to a general overall expansion of the universe. The Hubble law, enunciated in 1929, marked a major turning point in modern thinking about the origin and evolution of the universe. The announcement of cosmological expansion came at a time when scientists were beginning to grapple with the theoretical implications of the revolutions taking place in physics. In his theory of special relativity , formulated in 1905, Einstein had effected a union of space and time, one that fundamentally modified Newtonian perceptions of dynamics, allowing, for example, transformations between mass and energy. In his theory of general relativity , proposed in 1916, Einstein effected an even more remarkable union, one that fundamentally altered Newtonian perceptions of gravitation , allowing gravitation to be seen, not as a force, but as the dynamics of space-time . Taken together, the discoveries of Hubble and Einstein gave rise to a new worldview. The new cosmology gave empirical validation to the notion of a creation event ; it assigned a numerical estimate for when the arrow of time first took flight; and it eventually led to the breathtaking idea that everything in the universe could have arisen from literally nothing.",
