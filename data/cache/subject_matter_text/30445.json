  " dilemma , in syllogistic, or traditional, logic, any one of several forms of inference in which there are two major premises of hypothetical form and a disjunctive (\u201ceither . . . or\u201d) minor premise. For example:",
  "If we increase the price, sales will slump.",
  "If we decrease the quality, sales will slump.",
  "Either we increase the price or",
  "we decrease the quality.",
  "Therefore, sales will slump.",
  "In logic \u2283 signifies \u201cif . . . then\u201d; \u2228 signifies \u201ceither . . . or\u201d. Symbolically, therefore, a dilemma is an argument of the form A \u2283 C, B \u2283 C, A \u2228 B, therefore C .",
  "It is not necessary that a dilemma should have an unwelcome conclusion; but from its use in rhetoric the word has come to mean a situation in which each of the alternative courses of action (presented as the only ones open) leads to some unsatisfactory consequence. To take a familiar example, a person who is asked, \u201cHave you stopped beating your wife?\u201d is presented with a rhetorical dilemma. In this more complicated version of the dilemma, however, two unwelcome results are presented instead of one ( C, above). Thus, the conclusion itself becomes a disjunction:",
  "Either you have been beating your wife or you are continuing to beat her."
