  " spinning , in textiles, process of drawing out fibres from a mass and twisting them together to form a continuous thread or yarn. In man-made fibre production the name is applied to the extrusion of a solution to form a fibre, a process similar to the method by which silkworms and similar insect larvae produce filament to make their cocoons from a viscous fluid that they secrete.",
  "Common industrial spinning techniques include ring spinning, open-end (rotor) spinning, and air-jet spinning."
