  " complementary colour , one of a pair of colours that are opposite each other on the traditional colour wheel.",
  "The complementary colour to one of the primary hues\u2014red, yellow, and blue\u2014is the mixture of the other two; complementary to red, for example, is green, which is blue mixed with yellow. When complementary pairs are juxtaposed, mutual enhancement of colour intensity results. For instance, red and green are more intense when they are next to one another\u00a0than either would be if surrounded by harmonious hues. The 19th-century physicist Michel-Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul referred to this mutual exaltation of opposites as the\u00a0law of simultaneous contrast."
