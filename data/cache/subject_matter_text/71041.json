  " talent , unit of weight used by many ancient civilizations, such as the Hebrews, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. The weight of a talent and its relationship to its major subdivision, the mina , varied considerably over time and location in the ancient world. The most common ratio of the talent to the mina was probably 1:60.",
  "The Hebrew talent, or kikk\u0101r , probably of Babylonian origin, was the basic unit of weight among the ancient Hebrews. In the sacred system of weights, the Talmudic talent was equal to 60 Talmudic minas.",
  "The talent was also an important unit of weight among the Greeks, who undoubtedly borrowed it from eastern neighbours. The Attic talent, which equaled 60 Attic minas, is estimated to have weighed about 56.9 pounds (25.8 kg). It was certainly smaller than the Hebrew talent."
