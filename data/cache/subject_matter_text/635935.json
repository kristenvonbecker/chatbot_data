  "  electric guitar ,  guitar (plucked stringed musical instrument) that uses electronic amplification in order to be heard at a louder volume, by translating the vibrations of the strings into electrical currents. These electric signals are picked up and amplified by an external amplifier or a speaker. Sounds from the instrument can also be distorted and modified. While there are many variations on the neck length, shape, number of strings, and general build of electric guitars, most of them consist of the same elements: a body, usually made of wood or plaster, which comprises the bulk of the guitar and can be shaped in a variety of ways; a headstock, into which the tuners are set; a nut which holds the strings in place; strings; a neck that connects the headstock to the body and supports the strings; frets, which maintain the desired pitch when the strings are pressed; electrical current pickups; and control knobs with which volume and tone can be adjusted. Although efforts to create an electrified fretted string instrument date to the late 19th century, the first true electric guitar was invented in the early 1930s by George Beauchamp, with the help of Adolph Rickenbacker, for the Electro String Instrument Corporation. The electric guitar would prove to be vital to the development of popular music throughout the world in the 20th century, and it continues to be one of the most commonly played instruments across cultures today.",
  "  The electric guitar was born out of a simple need for louder music. In the United States, dance music in public spaces became increasingly common during the 1920s as jazz exploded in popularity. Electronic amplification made it possible for the guitar to be heard among the other instruments in the big bands (especially the large brass sections) of the swing era of the 1930s and \u201940s. In addition to swing-jazz guitarists such as Charlie Christian , the first musicians to make use of Beauchamp\u2019s innovation played Hawaiian-style and country music . In the 1940s and \u201950s, as the blues migrated northward from the rural American South, electrification made it easier for the guitar to compete with the cacophony of the patrons in crowded bars and clubs in Chicago and other cities to which musicians such as Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin\u2019 Wolf had relocated.",
  "The first electric guitars were, like their acoustic counterparts, hollow-bodied. The most noticeable difference was the inclusion of tungsten steel pickups. The iconic solid-body electric guitar was created by guitarist Les Paul in 1941. No longer relying on any acoustic amplification, the solid-body electric guitar could make much smoother, more sonically isolated tones. The technology for pickups\u2014the nodes attached to the steel strings that transferred electric currents to amplifiers\u2014also advanced quickly about the same time. Most electric guitars had begun to use smaller magnetic single- or double-coil pickups. These pickups are what supply the instrument\u2019s signature electric hum.",
  "While Les Paul and the Gibson Guitar Company readied an electric guitar for mass production, Leo Fender and the Fender Electric Instruments Company beat them to the punch, marketing the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar, the Fender Broadcaster (later renamed Telecaster), in 1948. The Les Paul Standard became available in 1952. Two years later Fender introduced the iconic Stratocaster, which featured three electric pickups (instead of two).",
  "    As rhythm and blues , rockabilly , and rock and roll began to emerge in the 1950s, the new sounds and tones that the electric guitar was capable of making were embraced by a new generation of musicians, including Chuck Berry , Bo Diddley , Carl Perkins , and Buddy Holly . These artists and their contemporaries sparked a conservative backlash against what older generations considered to be immoral, lascivious music. Beyond its sound, the electric guitar became a symbol and a talisman for the burgeoning youth culture.",
  "  In the 1960s manufacturers started equipping preamplifiers (or preamps; separate amplifiers that can adjust the tone and volume of certain sounds) with a range of effects, such as tremolo (a wavering or trembling effect), wah-wah (a fluctuating muted sound, like the covering and uncovering of the bell of a trumpet), and distortion. Guitarists used these innovations to explore new sounds and create new subgenres of rock music . Partly because of their ability to make fuller, louder sounds, electric guitars also lent themselves to use as solo instruments (sometimes used in \u201cdueling\u201d counterpoint) as well as rhythm instruments. Some novel techniques that electric guitars allow for include string-bending, hammering, and sliding. The instrument\u2019s popularity and sonic possibilities also paved the way for the electrification of other acoustic instruments like the bass .",
  "  Some of the musicians (not already mentioned) who gained reputations as virtuoso electric guitarists and innovators were blues masters B.B. King , Albert King , John Lee Hooker , and Buddy Guy ; gospel singer and guitarist Sister Rosetta Tharpe; influential country music makers Chet Atkins and Merle Travis ; rock \u201cguitar gods\u201d Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton ; and heavy metal mavens Jimmy Page ( Led Zepplin ), Tony Iommi ( Black Sabbath ), Eddie Van Halen ( Van Halen ), Angus Young ( AC/DC ), Slash ( Guns N\u2019 Roses ), and James Hetfield ( Metallica ); along with George Harrison (the Beatles ), Keith Richards (the Rolling Stones ), Pete Townshend (the Who ), David Gilmour ( Pink Floyd ), Robbie Robertson (the Band ), Mark Knopfler ( Dire Straits ), Kurt Cobain ( Nirvana ), James Burton, Duane Eddy , Jeff Beck , Carlos Santana , Neil Young , John McLaughlin , and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Though most commonly associated with American and British popular music, the electric guitar has been used by musicians throughout the world\u2014notably Nigeria\u2019s King Sunny Ad\u00e9 \u2014to build on, distort, and experiment with traditional sounds."
