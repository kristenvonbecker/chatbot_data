  " The Dead Lecturer , collection of verse by Amiri Baraka , published in 1964 under the name LeRoi Jones. The collection marked a separation for Baraka from the style and literary philosophy of the Beats , with whom he had previously been associated. In the poem \u201cRhythm & Blues\u201d he used the structures of jazz and blues to forge a new, distinctly African American voice. Poems such as \u201cBlack Dada Nihilismus\u201d and \u201cAn Agony. As Now.\u201d reveal the anger and despair of a black man trapped in a white middle-class society. Despite the inaccessibility of some of the poems, the collection is notable for its strong imagery and lyrical treatment of violence."
