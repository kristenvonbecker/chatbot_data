  " Bob and Ray , bynames of Robert Brackett Elliott and Raymond Walter Goulding , (respectively, born March 26, 1923, Boston, Mass., U.S.\u2014died February 2, 2016, Cundys Harbor, Maine; born March 20, 1922, Lowell, Mass.\u2014died March 24, 1990, Manhasset, N.Y.), American comedians best known for satirical radio programs.",
  "Both Elliott and Goulding served in the U.S. Army during World War II. They met while working for radio station WHDH in Boston, Elliott as a disk jockey and Goulding as a news broadcaster on Elliott\u2019s program. The on-air banter between the two was the beginning of their comedy team; their facility for comic improvisation was demonstrated on the daily Matinee with Bob and Ray program beginning in 1946. Five years later they gained national recognition on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio network; they also had broadcast series on the Columbia and Mutual radio networks and on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television network.",
  "The characters they created included inept interviewer Wally Ballou, cooking host Mary McGoon, detective Mr. Trace (Keener than Most Persons), Charles the poet, and soap opera heroines Linda Lovely and Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife. They were most popular during the 1950s; subsequently they performed on radio and in the theatre, in The Two and Only (1970), but seldom on television. They continued to work together until Goulding\u2019s health declined in 1988."
