  "  electromagnetic spectrum , the entire distribution of electromagnetic radiation according to frequency or wavelength . Although all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, they do so at a wide range of frequencies, wavelengths, and photon energies. The electromagnetic spectrum comprises the span of all electromagnetic radiation and consists of many subranges, commonly referred to as portions, such as visible light or ultraviolet radiation. The various portions bear different names based on differences in behaviour in the emission, transmission, and absorption of the corresponding waves and also based on their different practical applications. There are no precise accepted boundaries between any of these contiguous portions, so the ranges tend to overlap.",
  "  The entire electromagnetic spectrum, from the lowest to the highest frequency (longest to shortest wavelength), includes all radio waves (e.g., commercial radio and television , microwaves , radar ), infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation , X-rays , and gamma rays . Nearly all frequencies and wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation can be used for spectroscopy ."
