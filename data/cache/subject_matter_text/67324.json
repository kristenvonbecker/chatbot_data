  " R.C. Sherriff , byname of Robert Cedric Sherriff , (born June 6, 1896, Hampton Wick, Surrey, England\u2014died November 13, 1975, London), English playwright and screenwriter, remembered for his Journey\u2019s End (1928), a World War I play that won wide critical acclaim.",
  "After attending grammar school at Kingston on Thames, Sherriff worked in his father\u2019s insurance business until he entered the army in World War I, serving as a captain in the East Surrey Regiment. After the war he worked for several years as a claims adjuster and began to write. He drew on his war experiences in the writing of Journey\u2019s End . A moving account of life in a dugout on the Western Front in 1918, the play met with instant success in London and ran for 595 performances, later duplicating this success all over the world. The rest of his plays suffered by comparison with his masterpiece, though Home at Seven (1950) is still sometimes performed.",
  "Sherriff also wrote a number of successful film scripts, including The Invisible Man (1933),  Goodbye, Mr. Chips  (1939), Odd Man Out (1947), and The Dam Busters (1955). His autobiography, No Leading Lady, was published in 1968."
