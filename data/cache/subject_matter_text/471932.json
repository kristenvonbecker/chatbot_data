  " building code , Systematic statement of a body of rules that govern and constrain the design, construction, alteration, and repair of buildings. Such codes are based on requirements for the safety, health, and quality of life of building users and neighbors, and vary from city to city. Model codes developed by states, professional societies, and trade associations\u2014including the BOCA (Building Officials and Code Administrators) coda, National Building Code, Uniform Building Code, and Standard Building Code\u2014are typically adopted by local communities, with amendments. New York City\u2019s code is the oldest (1916) and, because of the city\u2019s population density and such concerns as fire prevention, adequate light, and ventilation, the most stringent."
