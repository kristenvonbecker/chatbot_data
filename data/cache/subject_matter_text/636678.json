  " cornstarch , also spelled corn starch , also called cornflour or maize starch , substance produced through wet milling of corn ( Zea mays ). Wet milling separates the components of corn kernels, which consist primarily of protein , fibre, starch , and oil . Once separated, the starch is dried, forming a white powder called cornstarch.",
  "Cornstarch is high in carbohydrates but lacking in vitamins, protein, fibre, and minerals, making it one of the least nutritionally dense components of corn. Cornstarch absorbs moisture, however, making it useful as a thickener and anticaking agent in food products. It is used in certain oral medications, where it facilitates the disintegration of capsules and tablets. It may be used as a substitute for wheat flour in gluten -free foods and as a substitute for baby powder. Other applications are, for example, in the production of paper, acrylic paint products, and adhesives."
