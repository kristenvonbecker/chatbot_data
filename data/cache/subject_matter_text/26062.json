  " continued fraction , expression of a number as the sum of an integer and a quotient, the denominator of which is the sum of an integer and a quotient, and so on. In general,",

  "where a  0 , a  1 , a  2 , \u2026 and b  0 , b  1 , b  2 , \u2026 are all integers.",
  "In a simple continued fraction (SCF), all the b   i  are equal to 1 and all the a   i  are positive integers. An SCF is written, in the compact form, [ a  0 ; a  1 , a  2 , a  3 , \u2026]. If the number of terms a   i  is finite, the SCF is said to terminate, and it represents a rational number; for example,  802  251  = [3; 5, 8, 6]. If the number of these terms is infinite, the SCF does not terminate, and it represents an irrational number; for example, 23 = [4; 1, 3, 1, 8 ], in which the bar spans a sequence of terms that repeats indefinitely. A nonterminating SCF in which a sequence of terms recurs represents an irrational number that is a root of a quadratic equation with rational coefficients. Nonterminating SCFs that represent numbers such as \u03c0 or e can be evaluated after any given number of terms to obtain a rational approximation to the irrational quantity."
