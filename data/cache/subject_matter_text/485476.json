  " Leaves of Grass , collection of poetry by American author Walt Whitman , first presented as a group of 12 poems published anonymously in 1855. It was followed by five revised and three reissued editions during the author\u2019s lifetime. Poems not published in his lifetime were added in 1897. The unconventional and expansive language and subjects of the poems exerted a strong influence on American and foreign literature but also led to the book\u2019s suppression on charges of indecency.",
  "The first edition included noted poems such as \u201c Song of Myself \u201d and \u201c I Sing the Body Electric ,\u201d celebrating the beauty of the human body, physical health, and sexual passion. In a preface that was deleted from later editions, Whitman maintained that a poet\u2019s style should be simple and natural, without orthodox metre or rhyme, like an animal or tree in harmony with its environment.",
  " Life and Adventures of Jack Engle Leaves of Grass  Among the 122 new poems in the third edition (1860\u201361) were Whitman\u2019s \u201cCalamus\u201d poems, which record an intense homosexual love affair. His Civil War poems,  Drum-Taps  (1865) and Sequel to Drum-Taps (1865), were included in the fourth edition (1867). The seventh edition (1881\u201382) grouped the poems in their final order, and the eighth edition (1889) incorporated his November Boughs (1888). \u201cGarrulous to the very last\u201d (as he wrote), he contemplated death yet also wrote buoyant poems for his ninth, \u201cdeathbed\u201d edition (1891\u201392)."
