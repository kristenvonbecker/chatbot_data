  "  Seven Cities of C\u00edbola , Spanish Las Siete Ciudades de C\u00edbola , legendary cities of splendour and riches sought in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadores in North America. The fabulous cities were first reported by \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca who, after being shipwrecked off Florida in 1528, had wandered through what later became Texas and northern Mexico before his rescue in 1536. The viceroy of New Spain , Antonio de Mendoza, sent an expedition in 1539 under Est\u00e9ban, a black slave who had been shipwrecked with Cabeza de Vaca, and Fray Marcos de Niza to verify de Vaca\u2019s reports. Fray Marcos, assured of the cities\u2019 existence by an Indian informant, claimed to have seen them in the distance. In 1540 Mendoza dispatched Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado to search for the cities. Instead of finding the legendary cities, though, Coronado encountered only Indian settlements\u2014including the Zuni Pueblos, which originally had inspired the false legend\u2014even though he explored as far north as modern Kansas ."
