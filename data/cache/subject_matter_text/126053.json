  " Sarah Chauncey Woolsey , pseudonym Susan Coolidge , (born Jan. 29, 1835, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.\u2014died April 9, 1905, Newport, R.I.), American children\u2019s author whose vivacious and mischievous heroines presented a popular contrast to the norm of her day.",
  "Woolsey displayed a love for reading and writing stories at an early age. In 1855 she moved with her family to New Haven, Connecticut (her uncle, Theodore Dwight Woolsey , was president of Yale College). During the Civil War she was active in hospital work. In 1870, after her father\u2019s death, the family settled in Newport, Rhode Island. By that time Sarah Woolsey had already published a few magazine articles, and, in part through the influence of her close friend Helen Hunt (Jackson) , she began to write in earnest.",
  "Woolsey\u2019s first book, a collection of stories for girls, appeared as The New-Year\u2019s Bargain under the pseudonym Susan Coolidge in 1871. She used that name thereafter. Her subsequent books include What Katy Did (1872), a novel for girls that was inspired by her own childhood and was the first of a highly popular series; Mischief\u2019s Thanksgiving (1874); Eyebright (1879); A Little Country Girl (1885); Just Sixteen (1889); The Barberry Bush (1893); and An Old Convent School in Paris and Other Papers (1895). The good-natured mischief and high-spirited heroines of Woolsey\u2019s books set them apart from much contemporary literature and helped them retain their popularity for decades.",
  "Woolsey also published three volumes of poetry, Verses (1880), A Few More Verses (1889), and Last Verses (published posthumously in 1906); brought out editions of The Autobiography and Correspondence of Mrs. Delany (1879), The Diary and Letters of Frances Burney, Mme. d\u2019Arblay (1880), and Letters of Jane Austen (1892); and translated Th\u00e9ophile Gautier\u2019s My Household of Pets (1882)."
