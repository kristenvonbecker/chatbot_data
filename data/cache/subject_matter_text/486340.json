  " Ragged Dick , children\u2019s book by Horatio Alger, Jr. , published serially in 1867 and in book form in 1868. Alternately titled Street Life in New York with the Bootblacks , the popular though formulaic story chronicles the successful rise of the title character from rags to respectability. Like most of Alger\u2019s novels, Ragged Dick served a second purpose as a guide to proper behaviour for city youth."
