He married Katherine Sergeant Angell, The New Yorker \u2019s first fiction editor, in 1929, and he remained with the weekly magazine for the rest of his career. White\u2019s essays for The New Yorker quickly garnered critical praise. Written in a personal, direct style that showcased an affable sense of humour, his witty pieces contained musings about city life, politics, and literature, among other subjects. White also wrote poems, cartoon captions, and brief sketches for the magazine, and his writings helped establish its intellectual and cosmopolitan tone. White collaborated with James Thurber on Is Sex Necessary? (1929), a spoof of contemporary sex manuals. In a monthly column (1938\u201343) for Harper\u2019s magazine, he wrote essays about rural life.",

In 1959 he revised and published a book by the late William Strunk, Jr., The Elements of Style, which became a standard style manual for writing in English.
