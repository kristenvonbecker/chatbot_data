  " United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) , autonomous United Nations body established in 1963 to conduct research into the problems and policies of social and economic development. UNRISD is dependent on voluntary contributions from governments, from other UN organizations, and from various national and international agencies because it does not receive monies from the regular UN budget; it has been supported by 15, primarily European, governments.",
  "As a research organ, UNRISD investigates the relations between social and economic change during varying phases of economic growth. UNRISD\u2019s autonomous position frees it to conduct research using and interpreting its own data, to question internationally fashionable assumptions, and to propose alternatives. Focusing on the practical issues of developing countries, UNRISD conducts systematic field studies and comparative analyses of social and economic development."
