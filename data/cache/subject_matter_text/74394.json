  " uplift , in geology, vertical elevation of the Earth\u2019s surface in response to natural causes. Broad, relatively slow and gentle uplift is termed warping, or epeirogeny, in contrast to the more concentrated and severe orogeny, the uplift associated with mountain building. Uplift during mountain building is commonly accompanied by erosion, until the crst is restored to normal thickness. The end result is the exposure of metamorphic rocks that formed in the roots of the mountain chain. Uplift of the Earth\u2019s surface also has occurred in response to the removal of Pleistocene ice sheets through melting and wastage. Such elastic reboundis both measurable and ongoing in southern Canada and in the general Scandinavian area today."
