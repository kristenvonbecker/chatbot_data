  " Transpacific Race , also called Honolulu Race , one of the world\u2019s oldest major ocean races for sailing yachts, a 2,225-mile (3,580-kilometre) event run from various California harbours to Honolulu , Hawaii. It was first held in 1906 and made a biennial event in 1939 to alternate with the Bermuda Race . Since 1941 the race has been from San Pedro, Calif. (Los Angeles\u2019 harbour), to Diamond Head Buoy, off Honolulu. Since the course is mostly downwind and there is no limitation on overall length of vessels, the race is notable for the speeds attained."
