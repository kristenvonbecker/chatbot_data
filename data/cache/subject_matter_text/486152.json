  " Pictures from Brueghel , in full Pictures from Brueghel, and Other Poems , collection of poetry by William Carlos Williams , published in 1962 and awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1963. In this volume Williams transcends the objectivist style of his earlier work, treating poetry as a medium for ideas as well as a means of depicting the physical world. Williams also explored new verse forms in the collection. Wanting to find a rhythm suited to American speech, he experimented with a version of free verse he termed versos sueltos (\u201cloose verses\u201d), which makes use of the triadic stanza and a variable foot measure."
