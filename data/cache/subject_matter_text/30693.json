  " divorce , the act by which a valid marriage is dissolved, usually freeing the parties to remarry. In regions in which ancient religious authority still predominates, divorce may be difficult and rare, especially when, as among Roman Catholics and Hindus, the religious tradition views marriage as indissoluble. (For Jewish tradition of divorce, see  ge\u1e6d .) Custom, however, may make divorce a simple matter in some societies. Among some Pueblo Indian tribes a woman could divorce her husband by leaving his moccasins on the doorstep. The principles of individual determination and mutual consent are making divorce increasingly acceptable in the industrialized parts of the world.",
  "Among premodern societies, the rate of marital stability is difficult to measure because of the varying definitions of marriage and divorce. It seems to be broadly true that wherever divorce is a legal impossibility the wedding is a well-defined event conducted with considerable formality. The contrary principle does not hold true: elaborate marriage ceremonial is quite compatible with high divorce rates. Many anthropologists agree that divorce is generally more permissible in matrilineal societies than in patrilineal ones, in which the procreative and sexual rights of the bride are often symbolically transferred to the husband with the payment of bride-price.
