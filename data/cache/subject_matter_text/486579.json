  " The Setting Sun , novel by Dazai Osamu , published in 1947 as Shay\u014d . It is a tragic, vividly painted story of life in postwar Japan.",
  "The narrator is Kazuko, a young woman born to gentility but now impoverished. Though she wears Western clothes, her outlook is Japanese; her life is static, and she recognizes that she is spiritually empty. In the course of the novel she survives the deaths of her aristocratic mother and her sensitive drug-addicted brother Naoji, an intellectual ravaged by his own and by society\u2019s spiritual failures. She also spends a sad, sordid night with the dissipated writer Uehara, and with him she conceives a child in the hope that it will be the first step in a moral revolution."
