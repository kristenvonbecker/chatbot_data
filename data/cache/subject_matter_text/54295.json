  "  Munsell colour system , method of designating colours based on a colour arrangement scheme developed by the American art instructor and painter Albert H. Munsell. It defines colours by measured scales of hue, value, and chroma, which correspond respectively to dominant wavelength, brightness, and strength or purity. The system is used internationally for specifying opaque colours of dyed or pigmented surfaces.",
  " Munsell introduced his system in 1913 with the publication of the Atlas of the Munsell Color System, which featured 15 colour charts consisting of several hundred colour chips arranged according to the three characteristics of hue, value, and chroma. After Munsell\u2019s death in 1918, the Munsell Color Company, Inc., carried on his work, publishing a new edition of the Atlas under the title Munsell Book of Color (1929). A three-dimensional representation of the Munsell system, sometimes called the Munsell colour tree, is shown in the figure ."
