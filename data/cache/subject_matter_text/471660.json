  " Discover , American popular science magazine founded in 1980 by Time, Inc., at the suggestion of the American journalist Leon Jaroff, who became the magazine\u2019s first managing editor. Discover is published in New York City.",
  "While working as a writer and editor for  Time  magazine in the early 1970s, Jaroff noticed that any cover of Time with a science - or medicine -related subject had significantly higher newsstand sales. To take advantage of the increasing public interest in science and medicine, Jaroff suggested that Time, Inc., publish a science-specific magazine. Finally, in 1980, Time started Discover magazine and hired Jaroff as its first managing editor. The magazine was sold to the Walt Disney Company in 1991 and then purchased in 2005 by Bob Guccione, Jr., who made it the flagship publication of the new Discover Media, LLC.",
  "Under the slogan \u201cScience, Technology, and the Future,\u201d Discover publishes consumer-oriented scientific information. It provides in-depth coverage of scientific topics while at the same time keeping articles relatively short and without too much technical detail or jargon. A wide range of scientific fields are covered, including astronomy, medicine, paleontology, and zoology. The magazine often includes profiles of or interviews with scientists and is known for its remarkable graphics. Discover has both online and print versions, as well as a number of blogs and a podcast . A separate magazine aimed at children, KIDS Discover , was created in 1991."
