  " The Sketch Book , in full The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. , short-story collection by Washington Irving , first published in 1819\u201320 in seven separate parts. Most of the book\u2019s 30-odd pieces concern Irving\u2019s impressions of England, but six chapters deal with American subjects. Of these the tales \u201c The Legend of Sleepy Hollow \u201d and \u201c Rip Van Winkle \u201d have been called the first American short stories, although both are actually Americanized versions of German folktales. In addition to the stories based on folklore, the collection contains travel sketches, literary essays, and miscellany. The Sketch Book was a celebrated event in American literary history. The collection was the first American work to gain international literary success and popularity. Its unprecedented success allowed Irving to devote himself to writing."
