  " incongruent melting , liquefaction of a solid accompanied by decomposition or by reaction with the melt to produce another solid and a liquid that differs in composition from the original solid. For example, enstatite, a magnesium silicate (MgSiO 3 ), melts incongruently at low pressures to form forsterite, which is another magnesium silicate (Mg 2 SiO 4 ), and a liquid enriched in silica (SiO 2 ). At pressures between 2.5 and 5.5 kilobars, the melting of enstatite is congruent."
