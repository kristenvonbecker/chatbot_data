  " leaf fish , any of about 10 species of fishes in the family Nandidae (order Perciformes). All live in fresh water, although some species may enter brackish water. Their geographic distribution is circumtropical, including the Amazon River basin, western Africa, India, southeastern Asia, and the Malay Archipelago.",
  "The name leaf fish is applied specifically to Monocirrhus polyacanthus, a South American species that is known for its close resemblance in both appearance and swimming behaviour to a dead, drifting leaf. This species is about 7.5 cm (3 inches) long and is coloured a mottled brown; it has serrated dorsal and anal fins that resemble the saw edges of leaves and a chin barbel that looks like a broken leaf stem. It lives in quiet waters, drifting about, often head down, and propelling itself with a transparent tail and pectoral fins. When feeding, it awaits an unsuspecting small fish or moves toward it slowly, taking it with a sudden gape of the huge mouth. Many members of the Nandidae family are popular aquarium fishes."
