  " diatomaceous earth , also called Kieselguhr , light-coloured, porous, and friable sedimentary rock that is composed of the siliceous shells of diatoms, unicellular aquatic plants of microscopic size. It occurs in earthy beds that somewhat resemble chalk, but it is much lighter than chalk and will not effervesce in acid. Under a high-powered microscope the form of the diatoms can be distinguished. When well hardened, it is called diatomite. Similar siliceous rocks, called radiolarian earth and radiolarite, are formed from the latticelike opaline skeletons of Radiolaria.",
  "Diatomaceous earth, formerly used principally as a filter in clarifying sugar and syrups, has been adapted to almost all industrial filtration applications, including the processing of oils, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, antibiotics, solvents, and chemicals. A second major use is as a filler or extender in paper, paint, brick, tile, ceramics, linoleum, plastic, soap, detergent, and a large number of other products. It also is used in the insulation of boilers, blast furnaces, and other devices in which high temperatures are maintained; at temperatures higher than 525\u00b0 C (about 1,000\u00b0 F) diatomaceous earth is a more efficient insulator than asbestos or magnesia because it is more resistant to shrinkage and does not fail at red heat. Other uses include sound insulation and vehicles for herbicides and fungicides. The oldest and best known commercial use is as a very mild abrasive in metal polishes and toothpaste.",
  "The largest deposit worked in the United States is in northern Santa Barbara County, California, where beds more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) thick extend over several square miles and vary from soft earth to hard, compact rock that can be sawed into blocks; other production has come from Nevada, Washington, and Oregon. Denmark, France, and Russia have well-developed diatomaceous earth industries, and numerous deposits exist in Algeria."
