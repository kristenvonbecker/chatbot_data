  " Walk off the Earth , Canadian music group that gained a reputation for their playful videos of cover songs and unique blend of folk , rock , pop , and reggae . The band gained an international following in 2012 with their cover of the Gotye song \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know,\u201d which the five band members performed simultaneously on one guitar .",
  "Gianni (\u201cLuminati\u201d) Nicassio (vocals, multi-instrumentalist) and Ryan Marshall (vocals, multi-instrumentalist) began playing together in Burlington , Ontario , in 2006 and gradually met the rest of the Walk off the Earth lineup through other local bands. The name \u201cWalk off the Earth\u201d (WOTE) reflects their desire for fans to forget about their problems and to \u201cwalk off the earth\u201d when listening to their music.",
  "For the first two WOTE albums, Smooth Like a Stone on a Beach (2007) and My Rock (2010), Luminati and Marshall were joined by Pete (\u201cPablo\u201d) Kirkwood on drums. Both records were produced by Luminati and released through his independent label, Slapdash Records. Kirkwood left the band following these two albums.",
  "Luminati and Marshall were then joined by classically trained pianist and multi-instrumentalist Mike Taylor. In 2011 Joel Cassady left Humber College\u2019s music program to become a drummer and multi-instrumentalist for WOTE. Sarah Blackwood was the lead singer of the Burlington punk band The Creepshow as well as a solo artist before joining Walk off the Earth. Blackwood became a regular contributor to the band in 2010 and joined permanently in 2012.",
  "The band began uploading videos of cover songs to YouTube in 2009. After coming up with an idea to have multiple people play one guitar, Luminati heard Gotye\u2019s \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know\u201d in 2011 and thought it would be the perfect fit for their next video. The performance was filmed in Luminati\u2019s kitchen the day after a New Year\u2019s Eve Party. The video received 35 million views in less than three weeks and attracted global attention.",
  "WOTE\u2019s major label debut, R.E.V.O. (an acronym for the band\u2019s motto, \u201cRealize Every Victory Outright\u201d), was released in October 2012. The four-song EP was produced by Justin Koop and cowritten with producer-songwriter Thomas (\u201cTawgs\u201d) Salter. The first single, \u201cRed Hands,\u201d was the first song written by the band\u2019s current lineup. It went double platinum in Canada and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart and No. 9 in the Canada Hot 100 chart.",
  "The full-length album R.E.V.O. , released in March 2013, includes the EP\u2019s four tracks, six more original songs, and the band\u2019s cover of \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know.\u201d R.E.V.O. was certified gold in Canada and earned the band Juno Award nominations for Breakthrough Group of the Year and Pop Album of the Year in 2013 and 2014, respectively.",
  "The band\u2019s second full-length record with Columbia Records, Sing It All Away , was released in June 2015. The two lead singles, \u201cRule the World\u201d and \u201cSing It All Away,\u201d were released in March and April 2015, respectively.
