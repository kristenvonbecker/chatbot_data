  "  wavelength , distance between corresponding points of two consecutive waves . \u201cCorresponding points\u201d refers to two points or particles in the same phase\u2014i.e., points that have completed identical fractions of their periodic motion. Usually, in transverse waves (waves with points oscillating at right angles to the direction of their advance), wavelength is measured from crest to crest or from trough to trough; in longitudinal waves (waves with points vibrating in the same direction as their advance), it is measured from compression to compression or from rarefaction to rarefaction. Wavelength is usually denoted by the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb); it is equal to the speed ( v ) of a wave train in a medium divided by its frequency ( f ): \u03bb = v / f ."
