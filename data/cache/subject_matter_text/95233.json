  " Black Range , mountain range extending 100 miles (160 km) north to south, through Catron and Sierra counties, southwestern New Mexico , U.S. The range follows the Continental Divide for much of its length. Most of the range lies within the Gila National Forest, near the headwaters of the Gila River . The highest point in the range is Reeds Peak (10,015 feet [3,053 metres]). State Highway 152, also called the Black Range Highway, was built through the mountains in 1937; most of the range is otherwise without roads, although a network of hiking trails enables access into the mountains at several points."
