  " The Turn of the Screw , novella by Henry James , published serially in Collier\u2019s Weekly in 1898 and published in book form later that year. One of the world\u2019s most famous ghost stories , the tale is told mostly through the journal of a governess and depicts her struggle to save her two young charges from the demonic influence of the eerie apparitions of two former servants in the household. The story inspired critical debate over the question of the \u201creality\u201d of the ghosts and of James\u2019s intentions. James himself, in his preface to volume XII of The Novels and Tales of Henry James , called the tale a \u201cfable\u201d and said that he did not specify details of the ghosts\u2019 evil deeds because he wanted readers to supply their own vision of terror."
