  " transposing musical instrument , instrument that produces a higher or lower pitch than indicated in music written for it. Examples include clarinets, the English horn, and saxophones. Musical notation written for transposing instruments shows the relative pitches, rather than the exact pitches, produced. Writing in this manner is a historical convention that often allows players to switch from a given instrument to a related one without relearning fingerings and other techniques (as from E\u266d clarinet to B\u266d clarinet or from English horn to oboe). The instrument name, as in the case of the B\u266d clarinet, often indicates the pitch resulting when the player sounds the note written as C. If the actual pitch is lower (or higher) than the notated pitch, the written music must be adjusted upward (or downward) by the same amount. Thus, in the key of C major the music for the B\u266d clarinet must be written in the key of D major.",
  "Although most transposing instruments belong to the woodwind and brass families, transposing keyboard instruments have also been built. The piccolo, contrabassoon, and other instruments whose parts are written an octave above or below the actual pitch (as c\u2032 above c) are not considered transposing instruments."
