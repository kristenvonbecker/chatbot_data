  "  white , in physics , light seen by the human eye when all wavelengths of the visible spectrum combine. Like black , but unlike the colours of the spectrum and most mixtures of them, white lacks hue, so it is considered an achromatic colour .",
  "   White and  black  are the most basic colour terms of languages. The word white derives from Proto-Germanic hwitaz and Old English hwit . One of the first written records of the term is from an Old English version of the phoenix legend, the so-called Prose Phoenix (11th century): \u201cHis fet syndon blodreade begen twegen and se bile hwit\u201d (\u201cHis feet are both blood red and the beak white\u201d).",
  "Pigments for white come from lead, lime, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and artificial chemical compounds. Lead white was used in cosmetics until the 20th century, when it was banned because of its toxicity, but it remains a favourite paint for many artists.",
  "  In addition to the gray scale, various colour systems have been used to classify white. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner\u2019s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint \u201cSnow White\u201d is compared to the \u201cBreast of the black-headed Gull,\u201d a \u201cSnow-Drop,\u201d and \u201cCarara Marble.\u201d In the Munsell colour system \u2014adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry\u2014 absolute white has a value of 10."
