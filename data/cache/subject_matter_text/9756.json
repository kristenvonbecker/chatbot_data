  " philosophy of as if , the system espoused by Hans Vaihinger in his major philosophical work Die Philosophie des Als Ob (1911; The Philosophy of \u201cAs If\u201d ), which proposed that man willingly accept falsehoods or fictions in order to live peacefully in an irrational world. Vaihinger, who saw life as a maze of contradictions and philosophy as a search for means to make life livable, began by accepting Immanuel Kant\u2019s view that knowledge is limited to phenomena and cannot reach to things-in-themselves. In order to survive, man must use his will to construct fictional explanations of phenomena \u201cas if \u201d there were rational grounds for believing that such a method reflects reality. Logical contradictions were simply disregarded. Thus in physics, man must proceed \u201cas if \u201d a material world exists independently of perceiving subjects; in behaviour, he must act \u201cas if \u201d ethical certainty were possible; in religion, he must believe \u201cas if \u201d there were a God.",
  "Vaihinger denied that his philosophy was a form of skepticism. He pointed out that skepticism implies a doubting; but in his \u201cas if \u201d philosophy there is nothing dubious about patently false fictions that, unlike ordinary hypotheses, are not subject to verification. Their acceptance is justified as nonrational solutions to problems that have no rational answers. Vaihinger\u2019s \u201cas if \u201d philosophy is interesting as a venture in the direction of pragmatism made quite independently of contemporary American developments."
