  " curve , In mathematics, an abstract term used to describe the path of a continuously moving point ( see  continuity ). Such a path is usually generated by an equation. The word can also apply to a straight line or to a series of line segments linked end to end. A closed curve is a path that repeats itself, and thus encloses one or more regions. Simple examples include circles , ellipses , and polygons . Open curves such as parabolas , hyperbolas , and spirals have infinite length."
