  " People , weekly American magazine specializing in stories about the personal lives of celebrities. The New York -based magazine is one of the best-selling weeklies in the world and the most profitable asset of its publisher, Time, Inc .",
  "In the decades since the American actress Mia Farrow appeared on the cover of its first issue in March 1974, People covers have showcased hundreds of film stars, musicians, performers, and political figures. Regular features include celebrity news and sightings, a fashion guide, movie and music reviews, and human-interest stories about ordinary people coping with extraordinary challenges. Annual special issues include Oscar Style , World\u2019s Most Beautiful People , Hottest Bachelors , Best and Worst Dressed , Sexiest Man Alive , and a best-of-the-year issue. Sister publications have included a Spanish-language version, the now-defunct Teen People , and People StyleWatch , a shopping guide to current celebrity fashion trends.",
  " People faced little serious competition until the early 21st century. Known for its intimate coverage of celebrities and political figures, the magazine earned a trusted place in American popular culture because of its refusal to publish unsubstantiated rumours. But People has also been criticized for paying exorbitant sums for exclusive photographs, thereby rapidly inflating costs in bidding wars among rival publications."
