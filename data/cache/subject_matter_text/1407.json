  " The Remote Sensing Tutorial  Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern , also called Widmanst\u00e4tten figure , lines that appear in some iron meteorites when a cross section of the meteorite is etched with weak acid . The pattern is named for Alois von Widmanst\u00e4tten, a Viennese scientist who discovered it in 1808. It represents a section through a three-dimensional octahedral structure in the metal that is formed of bands of kamacite with narrower borders of taenite , the meshes being filled with a mixture of these two alloys."
