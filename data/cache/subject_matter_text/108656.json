  " Discovery  astronomy , science that encompasses the study of all extraterrestrial objects and phenomena. Until the invention of the telescope and the discovery of the laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century, astronomy was primarily concerned with noting and predicting the positions of the Sun , Moon , and planets , originally for calendrical and astrological purposes and later for navigational uses and scientific interest. The catalog of objects now studied is much broader and includes, in order of increasing distance, the solar system , the stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy , and other, more distant galaxies . With the advent of scientific space probes, Earth also has come to be studied as one of the planets, though its more-detailed investigation remains the domain of the Earth sciences .",
  "Since the late 19th century, astronomy has expanded to include astrophysics, the application of physical and chemical knowledge to an understanding of the nature of celestial objects and the physical processes that control their formation, evolution, and emission of radiation . In addition, the gases and dust particles around and between the stars have become the subjects of much research. Study of the nuclear reactions that provide the energy radiated by stars has shown how the diversity of atoms found in nature can be derived from a universe that, following the first few minutes of its existence, consisted only of hydrogen , helium , and a trace of lithium . Concerned with phenomena on the largest scale is cosmology , the study of the evolution of the universe. Astrophysics has transformed cosmology from a purely speculative activity to a modern science capable of predictions that can be tested.",
  "  Its great advances notwithstanding, astronomy is still subject to a major constraint: it is inherently an observational rather than an experimental science. Almost all measurements must be performed at great distances from the objects of interest, with no control over such quantities as their temperature , pressure , or chemical composition. There are a few exceptions to this limitation\u2014namely, meteorites (most of which are from the asteroid belt, though some are from the Moon or Mars ), rock and soil samples brought back from the Moon , samples of comet and asteroid dust returned by robotic spacecraft, and interplanetary dust particles collected in or above the stratosphere . These can be examined with laboratory techniques to provide information that cannot be obtained in any other way. In the future, space missions may return surface materials from Mars, or other objects, but much of astronomy appears otherwise confined to Earth-based observations augmented by observations from orbiting satellites and long-range space probes and supplemented by theory.",
  "  A central undertaking in astronomy is the determination of distances. Without a knowledge of astronomical distances, the size of an observed object in space would remain nothing more than an angular diameter and the brightness of a star could not be converted into its true radiated power, or luminosity . Astronomical distance measurement began with a knowledge of Earth\u2019s diameter, which provided a base for triangulation. Within the inner solar system , some distances can now be better determined through the timing of radar reflections or, in the case of the Moon , through laser ranging. For the outer planets, triangulation is still used. Beyond the solar system, distances to the closest stars are determined through triangulation, in which the diameter of Earth\u2019s orbit serves as the baseline and shifts in stellar parallax are the measured quantities. Stellar distances are commonly expressed by astronomers in parsecs (pc), kiloparsecs, or megaparsecs. (1\u00a0pc\u00a0=\u00a03.086\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 18 cm, or about 3.26 light-years [1.92 \u00d7 10 13 miles].) Distances can be measured out to around a kiloparsec by trigonometric parallax ( see  star: Determining stellar distances ). The accuracy of measurements made from Earth\u2019s surface is limited by atmospheric effects, but measurements made from the Hipparcos satellite in the 1990s extended the scale to stars as far as 650 parsecs, with an accuracy of about a thousandth of an arc second. The Gaia satellite is expected to measure stars as far away as 10 kiloparsecs to an accuracy of 20 percent. Less-direct measurements must be used for more-distant stars and for galaxies .",
  "Two general methods for determining galactic distances are described here. In the first, a clearly identifiable type of star is used as a reference standard because its luminosity has been well determined. This requires observation of such stars that are close enough to Earth that their distances and luminosities have been reliably measured. Such a star is termed a \u201cstandard candle.\u201d Examples are Cepheid variables , whose brightness varies periodically in well-documented ways, and certain types of supernova explosions that have enormous brilliance and can thus be seen out to very great distances. Once the luminosities of such nearer standard candles have been calibrated, the distance to a farther standard candle can be calculated from its calibrated luminosity and its actual measured intensity. (The measured intensity [ I ] is related to the luminosity [ L ] and distance [ d ] by the formula I = L /4\u03c0 d  2 .) A standard candle can be identified by means of its spectrum or the pattern of regular variations in brightness. (Corrections may have to be made for the absorption of starlight by interstellar gas and dust over great distances.) This method forms the basis of measurements of distances to the closest galaxies.",
  "  The second method for galactic distance measurements makes use of the observation that the distances to galaxies generally correlate with the speeds with which those galaxies are receding from Earth (as determined from the Doppler shift in the wavelengths of their emitted light). This correlation is expressed in the Hubble law: velocity\u00a0= H \u00d7\u00a0distance, in which H denotes Hubble\u2019s constant , which must be determined from observations of the rate at which the galaxies are receding. There is widespread agreement that H lies between 67 and 73 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/sec/Mpc). H has been used to determine distances to remote galaxies in which standard candles have not been found. (For additional discussion of the recession of galaxies, the Hubble law, and galactic distance determination, see  physical science: Astronomy .)",
  "  The solar system took shape 4.57 billion years ago, when it condensed within a large cloud of gas and dust. Gravitational attraction holds the planets in their elliptical orbits around the Sun . In addition to Earth , five major planets ( Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn ) have been known from ancient times. Since then only two more have been discovered: Uranus by accident in 1781 and Neptune in 1846 after a deliberate search following a theoretical prediction based on observed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. Pluto , discovered in 1930 after a search for a planet predicted to lie beyond Neptune, was considered a major planet until 2006, when it was redesignated a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union .",
  "  The average Earth-Sun distance, which originally defined the astronomical unit (AU), provides a convenient measure for distances within the solar system. The astronomical unit was originally defined by observations of the mean radius of Earth\u2019s orbit but is now defined as 149,597,870.7 km (about 93 million miles). Mercury, at 0.4 AU, is the closest planet to the Sun, while Neptune, at 30.1 AU, is the farthest. Pluto\u2019s orbit, with a mean radius of 39.5 AU, is sufficiently eccentric that at times it is closer to the Sun than is Neptune. The planes of the planetary orbits are all within a few degrees of the ecliptic , the plane that contains Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun. As viewed from far above Earth\u2019s North Pole , all planets move in the same (counterclockwise) direction in their orbits.",
  "  Most of the mass of the solar system is concentrated in the Sun, with its 1.99\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 33 grams. Together, all of the planets amount to 2.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 30 grams (i.e., about one-thousandth of the Sun\u2019s mass), and Jupiter alone accounts for 71 percent of this amount. The solar system also contains five known objects of intermediate size classified as dwarf planets and a very large number of much smaller objects collectively called small bodies . The small bodies, roughly in order of decreasing size, are the asteroids , or minor planets; comets , including Kuiper belt , Centaur , and Oort cloud objects; meteoroids ; and interplanetary dust particles . Because of their starlike appearance when discovered, the largest of these bodies were termed asteroids , and that name is widely used, but, now that the rocky nature of these bodies is understood, their more descriptive name is minor planets.",
  "  The four inner, terrestrial planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars\u2014along with the Moon have average densities in the range of 3.9\u20135.5 grams per cubic cm, setting them apart from the four outer, giant planets\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune\u2014whose densities are all close to 1 gram per cubic cm, the density of water . The compositions of these two groups of planets must therefore be significantly different. This dissimilarity is thought to be attributable to conditions that prevailed during the early development of the solar system ( see below  Theories of origin ). Planetary temperatures now range from around 170 \u00b0C (330 \u00b0F, 440 K) on Mercury\u2019s surface through the typical 15 \u00b0C (60 \u00b0F, 290 K) on Earth to \u2212135 \u00b0C (\u2212210 \u00b0F, 140 K) on Jupiter near its cloud tops and down to \u2212210 \u00b0C (\u2212350 \u00b0F, 60 K) near Neptune\u2019s cloud tops. These are average temperatures; large variations exist between dayside and nightside for planets closest to the Sun, except for Venus with its thick atmosphere.",
  "  The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and many satellites show extensive cratering, produced by high-speed impacts ( see  meteorite crater ). On Earth, with its large quantities of water and an active atmosphere , many of these cosmic footprints have eroded , but remnants of very large craters can be seen in aerial and spacecraft photographs of the terrestrial surface. On Mercury, Mars, and the Moon, the absence of water and any significant atmosphere has left the craters unchanged for billions of years, apart from disturbances produced by infrequent later impacts. Volcanic activity has been an important force in the shaping of the surfaces of the Moon and the terrestrial planets. Seismic activity on the Moon has been monitored by means of seismometers left on its surface by Apollo astronauts and by Lunokhod robotic rovers. Cratering on the largest scale seems to have ceased about three billion years ago, although on the Moon there is clear evidence for a continued cosmic drizzle of small particles, with the larger objects churning (\u201cgardening\u201d) the lunar surface and the smallest producing microscopic impact pits in crystals in the lunar rocks.",
  "  All of the planets apart from the two closest to the Sun (Mercury and Venus) have natural satellites ( moons ) that are very diverse in appearance, size, and structure, as revealed in close-up observations from long-range space probes. The four outer dwarf planets have moons; Pluto has at least five moons, including one, Charon , fully half the size of Pluto itself. Over 200 asteroids and 80 Kuiper belt objects also have moons. Four planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), one dwarf planet ( Haumea ), and one Centaur object (Chariklo) have rings, disklike systems of small rocks and particles that orbit their parent bodies.",
  "  During the U.S. Apollo missions a total weight of 381.7 kg (841.5 pounds) of lunar material was collected; an additional 300 grams (0.66 pounds) was brought back by unmanned Soviet Luna vehicles. About 15 percent of the Apollo samples have been distributed for analysis, with the remainder stored at the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. The opportunity to employ a wide range of laboratory techniques on these lunar samples has revolutionized planetary science. The results of the analyses have enabled investigators to determine the composition and age of the lunar surface. Seismic observations have made it possible to probe the lunar interior. In addition, retroreflectors left on the Moon\u2019s surface by Apollo astronauts have allowed high-power laser beams to be sent from Earth to the Moon and back, permitting scientists to monitor the Earth-Moon distance to an accuracy of a few centimetres. This experiment, which has provided data used in calculations of the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system, has shown that the separation of the two bodies is increasing by 4.4 cm (1.7 inches) each year. (For additional information on lunar studies, see  Moon .)",
  "   Mercury is too hot to retain an atmosphere, but Venus \u2019s brilliant white appearance is the result of its being completely enveloped in thick clouds of carbon dioxide , impenetrable at visible wavelengths. Below the upper clouds, Venus has a hostile atmosphere containing clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. The cloud cover shields the planet\u2019s surface from direct sunlight, but the energy that does filter through warms the surface, which then radiates at infrared wavelengths. The long-wavelength infrared radiation is trapped by the dense clouds such that an efficient greenhouse effect keeps the surface temperature near 465 \u00b0C (870 \u00b0F, 740 K). Radar , which can penetrate the thick Venusian clouds, has been used to map the planet\u2019s surface. In contrast, the atmosphere of Mars is very thin and is composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95 percent), with very little water vapour; the planet\u2019s surface pressure is only about 0.006 that of Earth . The outer planets have atmospheres composed largely of light gases , mainly hydrogen and helium .",
  "Each planet rotates on its axis, and nearly all of them rotate in the same direction\u2014counterclockwise as viewed from above the ecliptic. The two exceptions are Venus, which rotates in the clockwise direction beneath its cloud cover, and Uranus , which has its rotation axis very nearly in the plane of the ecliptic .",
  "  Some of the planets have magnetic fields. Earth\u2019s field extends outward until it is disturbed by the solar wind \u2014an outward flow of protons and electrons from the Sun \u2014which carries a magnetic field along with it. Through processes not yet fully understood, particles from the solar wind and galactic cosmic rays (high-speed particles from outside the solar system) populate two doughnut-shaped regions called the Van Allen radiation belts . The inner belt extends from about 1,000 to 5,000 km (600 to 3,000 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface, and the outer from roughly 15,000 to 25,000 km (9,300 to 15,500 miles). In these belts, trapped particles spiral along paths that take them around Earth while bouncing back and forth between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with their orbits controlled by Earth\u2019s magnetic field. During periods of increased solar activity, these regions of trapped particles are disturbed, and some of the particles move down into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where they collide with atoms and molecules to produce auroras .",
  "   Jupiter has a magnetic field far stronger than Earth\u2019s and many more trapped electrons, whose synchrotron radiation ( electromagnetic radiation emitted by high-speed charged particles that are forced to move in curved paths, as under the influence of a magnetic field) is detectable from Earth. Bursts of increased radio emission are correlated with the position of Io , the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. Saturn has a magnetic field that is much weaker than Jupiter\u2019s, but it too has a region of trapped particles. Mercury has a weak magnetic field that is only about 1 percent as strong as Earth\u2019s and shows no evidence of trapped particles. Uranus and Neptune have fields that are less than one-tenth the strength of Saturn\u2019s and appear much more complex than that of Earth. No field has been detected around Venus or Mars.",
  "  More than 500,000 asteroids with well-established orbits are known, and thousands of additional objects are discovered each year. Hundreds of thousands more have been seen, but their orbits have not been as well determined. It is estimated that several million asteroids exist, but most are small, and their combined mass is estimated to be less than a thousandth that of Earth . Most of the asteroids have orbits close to the ecliptic and move in the asteroid belt, between 2.3 and 3.3 AU from the Sun . Because some asteroids travel in orbits that can bring them close to Earth, there is a possibility of a collision that could have devastating results ( see  Earth impact hazard ).",
  "   Comets are considered to come from a vast reservoir, the Oort cloud , orbiting the Sun at distances of 20,000\u201350,000 AU or more and containing trillions of icy objects\u2014latent comet nuclei\u2014with the potential to become active comets. Many comets have been observed over the centuries. Most make only a single pass through the inner solar system, but some are deflected by Jupiter or Saturn into orbits that allow them to return at predictable times. Halley\u2019s Comet is the best known of these periodic comets; its next return into the inner solar system is predicted for 2061. Many short-period comets are thought to come from the Kuiper belt , a region lying mainly between 30 AU and 50 AU from the Sun\u2014beyond Neptune\u2019s orbit but including part of Pluto\u2019s \u2014and housing perhaps hundreds of millions of comet nuclei. Very few comet masses have been well determined, but most are probably less than 10 18 grams, one-billionth the mass of Earth.",
  "  Since the 1990s more than a thousand comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been observed with large telescopes; a few are about half the size of Pluto, and Pluto is the largest Kuiper belt object. Pluto\u2019s orbital and physical characteristics had long caused it to be regarded as an anomaly among the planets. However, after the discovery of numerous other Pluto-like objects beyond Neptune, Pluto was seen to be no longer unique in its \u201cneighbourhood\u201d but rather a giant member of the local population. Consequently, in 2006 astronomers at the general assembly of the International Astronomical Union elected to create the new category of dwarf planets for objects with such qualifications. Pluto, Eris , and Ceres , the latter being the largest member of the asteroid belt, were given this distinction. Two other Kuiper belt objects, Makemake and Haumea , were also designated as dwarf planets.",
  "Smaller than the observed asteroids and comets are the meteoroids , lumps of stony or metallic material believed to be mostly fragments of asteroids. Meteoroids vary from small rocks to boulders weighing a ton or more. A relative few have orbits that bring them into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and down to the surface as meteorites . Most meteorites that have been collected on Earth are probably from asteroids. A few have been identified as being from the Moon , Mars , or the asteroid Vesta .",
  "  Meteorites are classified into three broad groups: stony (chondrites and achondrites; about 94 percent), iron (5 percent), and stony-iron (1 percent). Most meteoroids that enter the atmosphere heat up sufficiently to glow and appear as meteors, and the great majority of these vaporize completely or break up before they reach the surface. Many, perhaps most, meteors occur in showers ( see  meteor shower ) and follow orbits that seem to be identical with those of certain comets, thus pointing to a cometary origin. For example, each May, when Earth crosses the orbit of Halley\u2019s Comet, the Eta Aquarid meteor shower occurs. Micrometeorites ( interplanetary dust particles ), the smallest meteoroidal particles, can be detected from Earth-orbiting satellites or collected by specially equipped aircraft flying in the stratosphere and returned for laboratory inspection. Since the late 1960s numerous meteorites have been found in the Antarctic on the surface of stranded ice flows ( see  Antarctic meteorites ). Some meteorites contain microscopic crystals whose isotopic proportions are unique and appear to be dust grains that formed in the atmospheres of different stars .",
  "The age of the solar system, taken to be close to 4.6 billion years, has been derived from measurements of radioactivity in meteorites, lunar samples, and Earth\u2019s  crust . Abundances of isotopes of uranium , thorium , and rubidium and their decay products, lead and strontium , are the measured quantities.",
  "Assessment of the chemical composition of the solar system is based on data from Earth, the Moon, and meteorites as well as on the spectral analysis of light from the Sun and planets. In broad outline, the solar system abundances of the chemical elements decrease with increasing atomic weight . Hydrogen  atoms are by far the most abundant, constituting 91 percent; helium is next, with 8.9 percent; and all other types of atoms together amount to only 0.1 percent.",
  "  The origin of Earth , the Moon , and the solar system as a whole is a problem that has not yet been settled in detail. The Sun probably formed by condensation of the central region of a large cloud of gas and dust, with the planets and other bodies of the solar system forming soon after, their composition strongly influenced by the temperature and pressure gradients in the evolving solar nebula . Less-volatile materials could condense into solids relatively close to the Sun to form the terrestrial planets. The abundant, volatile lighter elements could condense only at much greater distances to form the giant gas planets.",
  "In the 1990s astronomers confirmed that other stars have one or more planets revolving around them. Studies of these planetary systems have both supported and challenged astronomers\u2019 theoretical models of how Earth\u2019s solar system formed. Unlike the solar system, many extrasolar planetary systems have large gas giants like Jupiter orbiting very close to their stars , and in some cases these \u201chot Jupiters\u201d are closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun.",
  "That so many gas giants, which form in the outer regions of their system, end up so close to their stars suggests that gas giants migrate and that such migration may have happened in the solar system\u2019s history. According to the Grand Tack hypothesis, Jupiter may have done so within a few million years of the solar system\u2019s formation. In this scenario, Jupiter is the first giant planet to form, at about 3 AU from the Sun. Drag from the protoplanetary disk causes it to fall inward to about 1.5 AU. However, by this time, Saturn begins to form at about 3 AU and captures Jupiter in a 3:2 resonance. (That is, for every three revolutions Jupiter makes, Saturn makes two.) The two planets migrate outward and clear away any material that would have gone to making Mars bigger. Mars should be bigger than Venus or Earth, but it is only half their size. The Grand Tack, in which Jupiter moves inward and then outward, explains Mars\u2019s small size.",
  "About 500 million years after the Grand Tack, according to the Nice Model (named after the French city where it was first proposed), after the four giant planets\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus , and Neptune \u2014formed, they orbited 5\u201317 AU from the Sun. These planets were in a disk of smaller bodies called planetesimals and in orbital resonances with each other. About four billion years ago, gravitational interactions with the planetesimals increased the eccentricity of the planets\u2019 orbits, driving them out of resonance. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune migrated outward, and Jupiter migrated slightly inward. (Uranus and Neptune may even have switched places.) This migration scattered the disk, causing the Late Heavy Bombardment. The final remnant of the disk became the Kuiper belt .",
  "The origin of the planetary satellites is not entirely settled. As to the origin of the Moon, the opinion of astronomers long oscillated between theories that saw its origin and condensation as simultaneous with the formation of Earth and those that posited a separate origin for the Moon and its later capture by Earth\u2019s gravitational field. Similarities and differences in abundances of the chemical elements and their isotopes on Earth and the Moon challenged each group of theories. Finally, in the 1980s a model emerged that gained the support of most lunar scientists\u2014that of a large impact on Earth and the expulsion of material that subsequently formed the Moon. ( See  Moon: Origin and evolution .) For the outer planets, with their multiple satellites, many very small and quite unlike one another, the picture is less clear. Some of these moons have relatively smooth icy surfaces, whereas others are heavily cratered; at least one, Jupiter\u2019s Io , is volcanic. Some of the moons may have formed along with their parent planets, and others may have formed elsewhere and been captured.",
  "  The first extrasolar planets were discovered in 1992, and more than 4,100 such planets are now known. Over 600 of these systems have more than one planet. Because planets are much fainter than their stars, fewer than 100 have been imaged directly. Most extrasolar planets have been found through their transit , the small dimming of a star\u2019s light when a planet passes in front of it.",
  "  Many of these planets are unlike those of the solar system. Hot Jupiters are large gas giants that orbit very close to their star. For example, HD 209458b is 0.69 times the mass of Jupiter and orbits its star every 3.52 days. Hot Neptunes are large ice giants about 10 percent of Jupiter\u2019s mass that also orbit very close to their star. Super-Earths are planets that are likely rocky like Earth but several times larger.",
  "  A primary goal of extrasolar planet research has been finding another planet that could support life . A useful guide for finding a life-supporting planet has been the concept of a habitable zone , the distance from a star where liquid water could survive on a planet\u2019s surface. About 20 planets have been found that are roughly Earth-sized and orbit in a habitable zone.",
  "  The measurable quantities in stellar astrophysics include the externally observable features of the stars : distance, temperature , radiation spectrum and luminosity, composition (of the outer layers), diameter, mass, and variability in any of these. Theoretical astrophysicists use these observations to model the structure of stars and to devise theories for their formation and evolution. Positional information can be used for dynamical analysis, which yields estimates of stellar masses.",
  "In a system dating back at least to the Greek astronomer-mathematician Hipparchus in the 2nd century bce , apparent stellar brightness ( m ) is measured in magnitudes . Magnitudes are now defined such that a first-magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a star of sixth magnitude. The human eye cannot see stars fainter than about sixth magnitude, but modern instruments used with large telescopes can record stars as faint as about 30th magnitude. By convention, the absolute magnitude ( M ) is defined as the magnitude that a star would appear to have if it were located at a standard distance of 10 parsecs . These quantities are related through the expression m \u2212 M =\u00a05\u00a0log 10  r \u2212\u00a05, in which r is the star\u2019s distance in parsecs.",
  "The magnitude scale is anchored on a group of standard stars. An absolute measure of radiant power is luminosity , which is related to the absolute magnitude and usually expressed in ergs per second (ergs/sec). (Sometimes the luminosity is stated in terms of the solar luminosity, 3.86\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 33 ergs/sec.) Luminosity can be calculated when m and r are known. Correction might be necessary for the interstellar absorption of starlight.",
  "There are several methods for measuring a star\u2019s diameter. From the brightness and distance, the luminosity ( L ) can be calculated, and, from observations of the brightness at different wavelengths, the temperature ( T ) can be calculated. Because the radiation from many stars can be well approximated by a Planck blackbody spectrum ( see  Planck\u2019s radiation law ), these measured quantities can be related through the expression L =\u00a04\u03c0 R  2 \u03c3 T  4 , thus providing a means of calculating R , the star\u2019s radius. In this expression, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant , 5.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ergs/cm 2  K  4 sec, in which K is the temperature in kelvins . (The radius R refers to the star\u2019s photosphere, the region where the star becomes effectively opaque to outside observation.) Stellar angular diameters can be measured through interferometry\u2014that is, the combining of several telescopes together to form a larger instrument that can resolve sizes smaller than those that an individual telescope can resolve. Alternatively, the intensity of the starlight can be monitored during occultation by the Moon , which produces diffraction fringes whose pattern depends on the angular diameter of the star. Stellar angular diameters of several milliarcseconds can be measured.",
  "Many stars occur in binary systems ( see  binary star ), in which the two partners orbit their mutual centre of mass. Such a system provides the best measurement of stellar masses. The period ( P ) of a binary system is related to the masses of the two stars ( m  1 and m  2 ) and the orbital semimajor axis (mean radius; a ) via Kepler\u2019s third law : P  2 =\u00a04\u03c0 2  a  3 / G ( m  1 + m  2 ). ( G is the universal gravitational constant.) From diameters and masses, average values of the stellar density can be calculated and thence the central pressure . With the assumption of an equation of state , the central temperature can then be calculated. For example, in the Sun the central density is 158 grams per cubic cm; the pressure is calculated to be more than one billion times the pressure of Earth\u2019s  atmosphere at sea level and the temperature around 15 million K (27 million \u00b0F). At this temperature, all atoms are ionized , and so the solar interior consists of a plasma , an ionized gas with hydrogen  nuclei (i.e., protons ), helium nuclei, and electrons as major constituents. A small fraction of the hydrogen nuclei possess sufficiently high speeds that, on colliding, their electrostatic repulsion is overcome, resulting in the formation, by means of a set of fusion reactions, of helium nuclei and a release of energy ( see  proton-proton cycle ). Some of this energy is carried away by neutrinos , but most of it is carried by photons to the surface of the Sun to maintain its luminosity.",
  "Other stars, both more and less massive than the Sun, have broadly similar structures, but the size, central pressure and temperature, and fusion rate are functions of the star\u2019s mass and composition. The stars and their internal fusion (and resulting luminosity) are held stable against collapse through a delicate balance between the inward pressure produced by gravitational attraction and the outward pressure supplied by the photons produced in the fusion reactions.",
  "  Stars that are in this condition of hydrostatic equilibrium are termed main-sequence stars, and they occupy a well-defined band on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram , in which luminosity is plotted against colour index or temperature. Spectral classification, based initially on the colour index, includes the major spectral types O, B, A, F, G, K and M, each subdivided into 10 parts ( see  star: Stellar spectra ). Temperature is deduced from broadband spectral measurements in several standard wavelength intervals. Measurement of apparent magnitudes in two spectral regions, the B and V bands (centred on 4350 and 5550 angstroms, respectively), permits calculation of the colour index , CI\u00a0= m   B  \u2212 m   V  , from which the temperature can be calculated.",
  "For a given temperature, there are stars that are much more luminous than main-sequence stars. Given the dependence of luminosity on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature ( R  2  T  4 of the luminosity expression above), greater luminosity implies larger radius, and such stars are termed giant stars or supergiant stars . Conversely, stars with luminosities much less than those of main-sequence stars of the same temperature must be smaller and are termed white dwarf stars . Surface temperatures of white dwarfs typically range from 10,000 to 12,000 K (18,000 to 21,000 \u00b0F), and they appear visually as white or blue-white.",
  "  The strength of spectral lines of the more abundant elements in a star\u2019s atmosphere allows additional subdivisions within a class. Thus, the Sun , a main-sequence star, is classified as G2 V, in which the V denotes main sequence. Betelgeuse , a red giant with a surface temperature about half that of the Sun but with a luminosity of about 10,000 solar units, is classified as M2 Iab. In this classification, the spectral type is M2, and the Iab indicates a giant, well above the main sequence on the H-R diagram.",
  "The range of physically allowable masses for stars is very narrow. If the star\u2019s mass is too small, the central temperature will be too low to sustain fusion reactions. The theoretical minimum stellar mass is about 0.08 solar mass. An upper theoretical bound called the Eddington limit , of several hundred solar masses, has been suggested, but this value is not firmly defined. Stars as massive as this will have luminosities about one million times greater than that of the Sun.",
  "  A general model of star formation and evolution has been developed, and the major features seem to be established. A large cloud of gas and dust can contract under its own gravitational attraction if its temperature is sufficiently low. As gravitational energy is released, the contracting central material heats up until a point is reached at which the outward radiation pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, and contraction ceases. Fusion reactions take over as the star\u2019s primary source of energy, and the star is then on the main sequence. The time to pass through these formative stages and onto the main sequence is less than 100 million years for a star with as much mass as the Sun. It takes longer for less massive stars and a much shorter time for those much more massive.",
  "Once a star has reached its main-sequence stage, it evolves relatively slowly, fusing hydrogen  nuclei in its core to form helium nuclei. Continued fusion not only releases the energy that is radiated but also results in nucleosynthesis , the production of heavier nuclei.",
  "Stellar evolution has of necessity been followed through computer modeling, because the timescales for most stages are generally too extended for measurable changes to be observed, even over a period of many years. One exception is the supernova , the violently explosive finale of certain stars. Different types of supernovas can be distinguished by their spectral lines and by changes in luminosity during and after the outburst. In Type Ia, a white dwarf star attracts matter from a nearby companion; when the white dwarf\u2019s mass exceeds about 1.4 solar masses, the star implodes and is completely destroyed. Type II supernovas are not as luminous as Type Ia and are the final evolutionary stage of stars more massive than about eight solar masses. Type Ib and Ic supernovas are like Type II in that they are from the collapse of a massive star, but they do not retain their hydrogen envelope.",
  "  The nature of the final products of stellar evolution depends on stellar mass. Some stars pass through an unstable stage in which their dimensions, temperature, and luminosity change cyclically over periods of hours or days. These so-called Cepheid variables serve as standard candles for distance measurements ( see above  Determining astronomical distances ). Some stars blow off their outer layers to produce planetary nebulas . The expanding material can be seen glowing in a thin shell as it disperses into the interstellar medium while the remnant core, initially with a surface temperature as high as 100,000 K (180,000 \u00b0F), cools to become a white dwarf. The maximum stellar mass that can exist as a white dwarf is about 1.4 solar masses and is known as the Chandrasekhar limit . More-massive stars may end up as either neutron stars or black holes .",
  "The average density of a white dwarf is calculated to exceed one million grams per cubic cm. Further compression is limited by a quantum condition called degeneracy ( see  degenerate gas ), in which only certain energies are allowed for the electrons in the star\u2019s interior. Under sufficiently great pressure, the electrons are forced to combine with protons to form neutrons . The resulting neutron star will have a density in the range of 10 14 \u201310 15 grams per cubic cm, comparable to the density within atomic nuclei. The behaviour of large masses having nuclear densities is not yet sufficiently understood to be able to set a limit on the maximum size of a neutron star, but it is thought to be less than three solar masses.",
  "Still more-massive remnants of stellar evolution would have smaller dimensions and would be even denser that neutron stars. Such remnants are conceived to be black holes, objects so compact that no radiation can escape from within a characteristic distance called the Schwarzschild radius . This critical dimension is defined by R   s  =\u00a02 G  M / c  2 . ( R   s  is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the object\u2019s mass, and c is the speed of light .) For an object of three solar masses, the Schwarzschild radius would be about three kilometres. Radiation emitted from beyond the Schwarzschild radius can still escape and be detected.",
  "    Although no light can be detected coming from within a black hole, the presence of a black hole may be manifested through the effects of its gravitational field, as, for example, in a binary star system. If a black hole is paired with a normal visible star , it may pull matter from its companion toward itself. This matter is accelerated as it approaches the black hole and becomes so intensely heated that it radiates large amounts of X-rays from the periphery of the black hole before reaching the Schwarzschild radius. Some candidates for stellar black holes have been found\u2014e.g., the X-ray source  Cygnus X-1 . Each of them has an estimated mass clearly exceeding that allowable for a neutron star, a factor crucial in the identification of possible black holes. Supermassive black holes that do not originate as individual stars exist at the centre of active galaxies ( see below  Study of other galaxies and related phenomena ). One such black hole, that at the center of the galaxy M87, has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun and has been directly observed.",
  "Whereas the existence of stellar black holes has been strongly indicated, the existence of neutron stars was confirmed in 1968 when they were identified with the then newly discovered pulsars , objects characterized by the emission of radiation at short and extremely regular intervals, generally between 1 and 1,000 pulses per second and stable to better than a part per billion. Pulsars are considered to be rotating neutron stars, remnants of some supernovas.",
  " Stars are not distributed randomly throughout space. Many stars are in systems consisting of two or three members separated by less than 1,000 AU. On a larger scale, star clusters may contain many thousands of stars. Galaxies are much larger systems of stars and usually include clouds of gas and dust.",
  "The solar system is located within the Milky Way Galaxy , close to its equatorial plane and about 8 kiloparsecs from the galactic centre. The galactic diameter is about 30 kiloparsecs, as indicated by luminous matter. There is evidence, however, for nonluminous matter\u2014so-called dark matter \u2014extending out nearly twice this distance. The entire system is rotating such that, at the position of the Sun , the orbital speed is about 220 km per second (almost 500,000 miles per hour) and a complete circuit takes roughly 240 million years. Application of Kepler\u2019s third law leads to an estimate for the galactic mass of about 100 billion solar masses. The rotational velocity can be measured from the Doppler shifts observed in the 21-cm emission line of neutral hydrogen and the lines of millimetre wavelengths from various molecules , especially carbon monoxide . At great distances from the galactic centre, the rotational velocity does not drop off as expected but rather increases slightly. This behaviour appears to require a much larger galactic mass than can be accounted for by the known (luminous) matter. Additional evidence for the presence of dark matter comes from a variety of other observations. The nature and extent of the dark matter (or missing mass) constitutes one of today\u2019s major astronomical puzzles.",
  "  There are about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Star concentrations within the galaxy fall into three types: open clusters, globular clusters, and associations ( see  star cluster ). Open clusters lie primarily in the disk of the galaxy; most contain between 50 and 1,000 stars within a region no more than 10 parsecs in diameter. Stellar associations tend to have somewhat fewer stars; moreover, the constituent stars are not as closely grouped as those in the clusters and are for the most part hotter. Globular clusters , which are widely scattered around the galaxy, may extend up to about 100 parsecs in diameter and may have as many as a million stars. The importance to astronomers of globular clusters lies in their use as indicators of the age of the galaxy. Because massive stars evolve more rapidly than do smaller stars, the age of a cluster can be estimated from its H-R diagram . In a young cluster the main sequence will be well populated, but in an old cluster the heavier stars will have evolved away from the main sequence. The extent of the depopulation of the main sequence provides an index of age. In this way, the oldest globular clusters have been found to be about 12.5 billion years old, which should therefore be the minimum age for the galaxy.",
  "  The interstellar medium , composed primarily of gas and dust, occupies the regions between the stars. On average, it contains less than one atom in each cubic centimetre, with about 1 percent of its mass in the form of minute dust grains. The gas, mostly hydrogen , has been mapped by means of its 21-cm emission line. The gas also contains numerous molecules . Some of these have been detected by the visible-wavelength absorption lines that they impose on the spectra of more-distant stars , while others have been identified by their own emission lines at millimetre wavelengths. Many of the interstellar molecules are found in giant molecular clouds , wherein complex organic molecules have been discovered.",
  "  In the vicinity of a very hot O- or B-type star, the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is sufficiently high to ionize the surrounding hydrogen out to a distance as great as 100 parsecs to produce an H II region , known as a Str\u00f6mgren sphere. Such regions are strong and characteristic emitters of radiation at radio wavelengths, and their dimensions are well calibrated in terms of the luminosity of the central star. Using radio interferometers, astronomers are able to measure the angular diameters of H II regions even in some external galaxies and can thereby deduce the great distances to those remote systems. This method can be used for distances up to about 30 megaparsecs. (For additional information on H II regions, see  nebula: Diffuse nebulae (H II regions) .)",
  " Interstellar dust grains scatter and absorb starlight, the effect being roughly inversely proportional to wavelength from the infrared to the near ultraviolet. As a result, stellar spectra tend to be reddened. Absorption typically amounts to about one magnitude per kiloparsec but varies considerably in different directions. Some dusty regions contain silicate materials, identified by a broad absorption feature around a wavelength of 10 \u03bcm. Other prominent spectral features in the infrared range have been sometimes, but not conclusively, attributed to graphite grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).",
  "Starlight often shows a small degree of polarization (a few percent), with the effect increasing with stellar distance. This is attributed to the scattering of the starlight from dust grains that have been partially aligned in a weak interstellar magnetic field. The strength of this field is estimated to be a few microgauss, very close to the strength inferred from observations of nonthermal cosmic radio noise. This radio background has been identified as synchrotron radiation , emitted by cosmic-ray electrons traveling at nearly the speed of light and moving along curved paths in the interstellar magnetic field. The spectrum of the cosmic radio noise is close to what is calculated on the basis of measurements of the cosmic rays near Earth .",
  " Cosmic rays constitute another component of the interstellar medium. Cosmic rays that are detected in the vicinity of Earth comprise high-speed nuclei and electrons . Individual particle energies, expressed in electron volts (eV; 1 eV\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u221212 erg), range with decreasing numbers from about 10 6 eV to more than 10 20 eV. Among the nuclei, hydrogen nuclei are the most plentiful at 86 percent, helium nuclei next at 13 percent, and all other nuclei together at about 1 percent. Electrons are about 2 percent as abundant as the nuclear component. (The relative numbers of different nuclei vary somewhat with kinetic energy , while the electron proportion is strongly energy-dependent.)",
  "A minority of cosmic rays detected in Earth\u2019s vicinity are produced in the Sun , especially at times of increased solar activity (as indicated by sunspots and solar flares ). The origin of galactic cosmic rays has not yet been conclusively identified, but they are thought to be produced in stellar processes such as supernova explosions, perhaps with additional acceleration occurring in the interstellar regions. (For additional information on interstellar matter, see  Milky Way Galaxy: The general interstellar medium .)",
  "  The central region of the Milky Way Galaxy is so heavily obscured by dust that direct observation has become possible only with the development of astronomy at nonvisual wavelengths\u2014namely, radio , infrared , and, more recently, X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths. Together, these observations have revealed a nuclear region of intense activity, with a large number of separate sources of emission and a great deal of dust. Detection of gamma-ray emission at a line energy of 511,000 eV, which corresponds to the annihilation of electrons and positrons (the antimatter counterpart of electrons), along with radio mapping of a region no more than 20 AU across, points to a very compact and energetic source, designated Sagittarius A* , at the centre of the galaxy. Sagittarius A* is a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 4,310,000 Suns.",
  "   Galaxies are normally classified into three principal types according to their appearance: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. Galactic diameters are typically in the tens of kiloparsecs and the distances between galaxies typically in megaparsecs.",
  "   Spiral galaxies \u2014of which the Milky Way system is a characteristic example\u2014tend to be flattened, roughly circular systems with their constituent stars strongly concentrated along spiral arms. These arms are thought to be produced by traveling density waves, which compress and expand the galactic material. Between the spiral arms exists a diffuse interstellar medium of gas and dust, mostly at very low temperatures (below 100 K [\u2212280 \u00b0F, \u2212170 \u00b0C]). Spiral galaxies are typically a few kiloparsecs in thickness; they have a central bulge and taper gradually toward the outer edges.",
  "   Ellipticals show none of the spiral features but are more densely packed stellar systems. They range in shape from nearly spherical to very flattened and contain little interstellar matter. Irregular galaxies number only a few percent of all stellar systems and exhibit none of the regular features associated with spirals or ellipticals.",
  "Properties vary considerably among the different types of galaxies. Spirals typically have masses in the range of a billion to a trillion solar masses, with ellipticals having values from 10 times smaller to 10 times larger and the irregulars generally 10\u2013100 times smaller. Visual galactic luminosities show similar spreads among the three types, but the irregulars tend to be less luminous. In contrast, at radio wavelengths the maximum luminosity for spirals is usually 100,000 times less than for ellipticals or irregulars.",
  "   Quasars are objects whose spectra display very large redshifts , thus implying (in accordance with the Hubble law) that they lie at the greatest distances ( see above  Determining astronomical distances ). They were discovered in 1963 but remained enigmatic for many years. They appear as starlike (i.e., very compact) sources of radio waves \u2014hence their initial designation as quasi-stellar radio sources, a term later shortened to quasars . They are now considered to be the exceedingly luminous cores of distant galaxies. These energetic cores, which emit copious quantities of X-rays and gamma rays, are termed active galactic nuclei (AGN) and include the object Cygnus A and the nuclei of a class of galaxies called Seyfert galaxies . They are powered by the infall of matter into supermassive black holes .",
  "  The Milky Way Galaxy is one of the Local Group of galaxies, which contains about four dozen members and extends over a volume about two megaparsecs in diameter. Two of the closest members are the Magellanic Clouds , irregular galaxies about 50 kiloparsecs away. At about 740 kiloparsecs, the Andromeda Galaxy is one of the most distant in the Local Group. Some members of the group are moving toward the Milky Way system while others are traveling away from it. At greater distances, all galaxies are moving away from the Milky Way Galaxy. Their speeds (as determined from the redshifted wavelengths in their spectra) are generally proportional to their distances. The Hubble law relates these two quantities ( see above  Determining astronomical distances ). In the absence of any other method, the Hubble law continues to be used for distance determinations to the farthest objects\u2014that is, galaxies and quasars for which redshifts can be measured.",
  " Cosmology is the scientific study of the universe as a unified whole, from its earliest moments through its evolution to its ultimate fate. The currently accepted cosmological model is the big bang . In this picture, the expansion of the universe started in an intense explosion 13.8 billion years ago. In this primordial fireball, the temperature exceeded one trillion K, and most of the energy was in the form of radiation . As the expansion proceeded (accompanied by cooling), the role of the radiation diminished, and other physical processes dominated in turn. Thus, after about three minutes, the temperature had dropped to the one-billion-K range, making it possible for nuclear reactions of protons to take place and produce nuclei of deuterium and helium . (At the higher temperatures that prevailed earlier, these nuclei would have been promptly disrupted by high-energy photons .) With further expansion, the time between nuclear collisions had increased and the proportion of deuterium and helium nuclei had stabilized. After a few hundred thousand years, the temperature must have dropped sufficiently for electrons to remain attached to nuclei to constitute atoms . Galaxies are thought to have begun forming after a few million years, but this stage is very poorly understood. Star formation probably started much later, after at least a billion years, and the process continues today.",
  "Observational support for this general model comes from several independent directions. The expansion has been documented by the redshifts observed in the spectra of galaxies. Furthermore, the radiation left over from the original fireball would have cooled with the expansion. Confirmation of this relic energy came in 1965 with one of the most striking cosmic discoveries of the 20th century\u2014the observation, at short radio wavelengths, of a widespread cosmic radiation corresponding to a temperature of almost 3 K (about \u2212270 \u00b0C [\u2212454 \u00b0F]). The shape of the observed spectrum is an excellent fit with the theoretical Planck blackbody spectrum. (The present best value for this temperature is 2.735 K, but it is still called three-degree radiation or the cosmic microwave background .) The spectrum of this cosmic radio noise peaks at approximately a one-millimetre wavelength, which is in the far infrared, a difficult region to observe from Earth; however, the spectrum has been well mapped by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) , Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , and Planck satellites. Additional support for the big bang theory comes from the observed cosmic abundances of deuterium and helium. Normal stellar nucleosynthesis cannot produce their measured quantities, which fit well with calculations of production during the early stages of the big bang.",
  "  Early surveys of the cosmic background radiation indicated that it is extremely uniform in all directions (isotropic). Calculations have shown that it is difficult to achieve this degree of isotropy unless there was a very early and rapid inflationary period before the expansion settled into its present mode. Nevertheless, the isotropy posed problems for models of galaxy formation. Galaxies originate from turbulent conditions that produce local fluctuations of density, toward which more matter would then be gravitationally attracted. Such density variations were difficult to reconcile with the isotropy required by observations of the 3 K radiation. This problem was solved when the COBE satellite was able to detect the minute fluctuations in the cosmic background from which the galaxies formed.",
  "The very earliest stages of the big bang are less well understood. The conditions of temperature and pressure that prevailed prior to the first microsecond require the introduction of theoretical ideas of subatomic particle physics. Subatomic particles are usually studied in laboratories with giant accelerators , but the region of particle energies of potential significance to the question at hand lies beyond the range of accelerators currently available. Fortunately, some important conclusions can be drawn from the observed cosmic helium abundance, which is dependent on conditions in the early big bang. The observed helium abundance sets a limit on the number of families of certain types of subatomic particles that can exist.",
  "The age of the universe can be calculated in several ways. Assuming the validity of the big bang model, one attempts to answer the question: How long has the universe been expanding in order to have reached its present size? The numbers relevant to calculating an answer are Hubble\u2019s constant (i.e., the current expansion rate), the density of matter in the universe, and the cosmological constant, which allows for change in the expansion rate. In 2003 a calculation based on a fresh determination of Hubble\u2019s constant yielded an age of 13.7\u00a0billion \u00b1\u00a0200 million years, although the precise value depends on certain assumed details of the model used. Independent estimates of stellar ages have yielded values less than this, as would be expected, but other estimates, based on supernova distance measurements, have arrived at values of about 15 billion years, still consistent, within the errors. In the big bang model the age is proportional to the reciprocal of Hubble\u2019s constant, hence the importance of determining H as reliably as possible. For example, a value for H of 100 km/sec/Mpc would lead to an age less than that of many stars, a physically unacceptable result.",
  "A small minority of astronomers have developed alternative cosmological theories that are seriously pursued. The overwhelming professional opinion, however, continues to support the big bang model.",
  "Finally, there is the question of the future behaviour of the universe: Is it open? That is to say, will the expansion continue indefinitely? Or is it closed, such that the expansion will slow down and eventually reverse, resulting in contraction? (The final collapse of such a contracting universe is sometimes termed the \u201cbig crunch.\u201d) The density of the universe seems to be at the critical density; that is, the universe is neither open nor closed but \u201cflat.\u201d So-called dark energy , a kind of repulsive force that is now believed to be a major component of the universe, appears to be the decisive factor in predictions of the long-term fate of the cosmos. If this energy is a cosmological constant (as proposed in 1917 by Albert Einstein to correct certain problems in his model of the universe), then the result would be a \u201cbig chill.\u201d In this scenario, the universe would continue to expand, but its density would decrease. While old stars would burn out, new stars would no longer form. The universe would become cold and dark. The dark (nonluminous) matter component of the universe, whose composition remains unknown, is not considered sufficient to close the universe and cause it to collapse; it now appears to contribute only a fourth of the density needed for closure.",
  "An additional factor in deciding the fate of the universe might be the mass of neutrinos . For decades the neutrino had been postulated to have zero mass, although there was no compelling theoretical reason for this to be so. From the observation of neutrinos generated in the Sun and other celestial sources such as supernovas, in cosmic-ray interactions with Earth\u2019s  atmosphere , and in particle accelerators, investigators have concluded that neutrinos have some mass, though only an extremely small fraction of the mass of an electron . Although there are vast numbers of neutrinos in the universe, the sum of such small neutrino masses appears insufficient to close the universe.",
  "Astronomical observations involve a sequence of stages, each of which may impose constraints on the type of information attainable. Radiant energy is collected with telescopes and brought to a focus on a detector, which is calibrated so that its sensitivity and spectral response are known. Accurate pointing and timing are required to permit the correlation of observations made with different instrument systems working in different wavelength intervals and located at places far apart. The radiation must be spectrally analyzed so that the processes responsible for radiation emission can be identified.",
  "  Before Galileo Galilei \u2019s use of telescopes for astronomy in 1609, all observations were made by naked eye, with corresponding limits on the faintness and degree of detail that could be seen. Since that time, telescopes have become central to astronomy. Having apertures much larger than the pupil of the human eye , telescopes permit the study of faint and distant objects. In addition, sufficient radiant energy can be collected in short time intervals to permit rapid fluctuations in intensity to be detected. Further, with more energy collected, a spectrum can be greatly dispersed and examined in much greater detail.",
  "Optical telescopes are either refractors or reflectors that use lenses or mirrors , respectively, for their main light-collecting elements (objectives). Refractors are effectively limited to apertures of about 100 cm (approximately 40 inches) or less because of problems inherent in the use of large glass lenses. These distort under their own weight and can be supported only around the perimeter; an appreciable amount of light is lost due to absorption in the glass. Large-aperture refractors are very long and require large and expensive domes. The largest modern telescopes are all reflectors, the very largest composed of many segmented components and having overall diameters of about 10 metres (33 feet). Reflectors are not subject to the chromatic problems of refractors, can be better supported mechanically, and can be housed in smaller domes because they are more compact than the long-tube refractors.",
  "The angular resolving power (or resolution) of a telescope is the smallest angle between close objects that can be seen clearly to be separate. Resolution is limited by the wave nature of light. For a telescope having an objective lens or mirror with diameter D and operating at wavelength \u03bb, the angular resolution (in radians) can be approximately described by the ratio \u03bb/ D . Optical telescopes can have very high intrinsic resolving powers; in practice, however, these are not attained for telescopes located on Earth\u2019s surface, because atmospheric effects limit the practical resolution to about one arc second. Sophisticated computing programs can allow much-improved resolution, and the performance of telescopes on Earth can be improved through the use of adaptive optics, in which the surface of the mirror is adjusted rapidly to compensate for atmospheric turbulence that would otherwise distort the image. In addition, image data from several telescopes focused on the same object can be merged optically and through computer processing to produce images having angular resolutions much greater than that from any single component.",
  "  The atmosphere does not transmit radiation of all wavelengths equally well. This restricts astronomy on Earth\u2019s surface to the near ultraviolet , visible, and radio regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and to some relatively narrow \u201cwindows\u201d in the nearer infrared. Longer infrared wavelengths are strongly absorbed by atmospheric water vapour and carbon dioxide . Atmospheric effects can be reduced by careful site selection and by carrying out observations at high altitudes. Most major optical observatories are located on high mountains , well away from cities and their reflected lights. Infrared telescopes have been located atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, in the Atacama Desert in Chile, and in the Canary Islands , where atmospheric humidity is very low. Airborne telescopes designed mainly for infrared observations\u2014such as on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), a jet aircraft fitted with astronomical instruments\u2014operate at an altitude of about 12 km (40,000 feet) with flight durations limited to a few hours. Telescopes for infrared , X-ray , and gamma-ray observations have been carried to altitudes of more than 30 km (100,000 feet) by balloons . Higher altitudes can be attained during short-duration rocket flights for ultraviolet observations. Telescopes for all wavelengths from infrared to gamma rays have been carried by robotic spacecraft observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , while cosmic rays have been studied from space by the Advanced Composition Explorer.",
  "  Angular resolution better than one milliarcsecond has been achieved at radio wavelengths by the use of several radio telescopes in an array. In such an arrangement, the effective aperture then becomes the greatest distance between component telescopes. For example, in the Very Large Array (VLA), operated near Socorro, New Mexico, by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, 27 movable radio dishes are set out along tracks that extend for nearly 21 km. In another technique, called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), simultaneous observations are made with radio telescopes thousands of kilometres apart; this technique requires very precise timing.",
  " Earth is a moving platform for astronomical observations. It is important that the specification of precise celestial coordinates be made in ways that correct for telescope location, the position of Earth in its orbit around the Sun , and the epoch of observation, since Earth\u2019s axis of rotation moves slowly over the years. Time measurements are now based on atomic clocks rather than on Earth\u2019s rotation, and telescopes can be driven continuously to compensate for the planet\u2019s rotation, so as to permit tracking of a given astronomical object.",
  "Although the human eye remains an important astronomical tool, detectors capable of greater sensitivity and more rapid response are needed to observe at visible wavelengths and, especially, to extend observations beyond that region of the electromagnetic spectrum . Photography was an essential tool from the late 19th century until the 1980s, when it was supplanted by charge-coupled devices (CCDs). However, photography still provides a useful archival record. A photograph of a particular celestial object may include the images of many other objects that were not of interest when the picture was taken but that become the focus of study years later. When quasars were discovered in 1963, for example, photographic plates exposed before 1900 and held in the Harvard College Observatory were examined to trace possible changes in position or intensity of the radio object newly identified as quasar 3C 273. Also, major photographic surveys, such as those of the National Geographic Society and the Palomar Observatory , can provide a historical base for long-term studies.",
  "Photographic film converted only a few percent of the incident photons into images, whereas CCDs have efficiencies of nearly 100 percent. CCDs can be used for a wide range of wavelengths, from the X-ray into the near- infrared . Gamma rays are detectable through their Compton scattering , electron - positron pair production, or Cerenkov radiation. For infrared wavelengths longer than a few microns, semiconductor detectors that operate at very low (cryogenic) temperatures are used. Reception of radio waves is based on the production of a small voltage in an antenna rather than on photon counting.",
  " Spectroscopy involves measuring the intensity of the radiation as a function of wavelength or frequency. In some detectors, such as those for X-rays and gamma rays, the energy of each photon can be measured directly. For low-resolution spectroscopy, broadband filters suffice to select wavelength intervals. Greater resolution can be obtained with prisms , gratings, and interferometers. (For additional information on astronomical radiation detectors, see  telescope: Advances in auxiliary instrumentation .)",
  "  Most of what is known about the universe comes from observations of electromagnetic radiation. However, there are other \u201ccosmic messengers.\u201d Gravity waves are disturbances in space-time that can be detected by very large laser interferometers. Gravity waves and gamma-ray bursts have been observed from neutron-star mergers. Neutrinos and cosmic rays are other particles that can, in principle, be observed; however, as yet, these latter messengers cannot be identified with specific sources. Using two or more of these methods is called multi-messenger astronomy.",
  "  As a departure from the traditional astronomical approach of remote observing, certain more recent lines of research involve the analysis of actual samples under laboratory conditions. These include studies of meteorites , rock samples returned from the Moon , cometary and asteroid dust samples returned by space probes, and interplanetary dust particles collected by aircraft in the stratosphere or by spacecraft. In all such cases, a wide range of highly sensitive laboratory techniques can be adapted for the often microscopic samples. Chemical analysis can be supplemented with mass spectrometry , allowing isotopic composition to be determined. Radioactivity and the impacts of cosmic-ray particles can produce minute quantities of gas , which then remain trapped in crystals within the samples. Carefully controlled heating of the crystals (or of dust grains containing the crystals) under laboratory conditions releases this gas, which then is analyzed in a mass spectrometer. X-ray spectrometers, electron microscopes , and microprobes are employed to determine crystal structure and composition, from which temperature and pressure conditions at the time of formation can be inferred.",
  "Theory is just as important as observation in astronomy. It is required for the interpretation of observational data; for the construction of models of celestial objects and physical processes, their properties, and their changes over time; and for guiding further observations. Theoretical astrophysics is based on laws of physics that have been validated with great precision through controlled experiments. Application of these laws to specific astrophysical problems, however, may yield equations too complex for direct solution. Two general approaches are then available. In the traditional method, a simplified description of the problem is formulated, incorporating only the major physical components, to provide equations that can be either solved directly or used to create a numerical model that can be evaluated ( see  numerical analysis ). Successively more-complex models can then be investigated. Alternatively, a computer program can be devised that will explore the problem numerically in all its complexity. Computational science has taken its place as a major division alongside theory and experiment. The test of any theory is its ability to incorporate the known facts and to make predictions that can be compared with additional observations.",
  "  No area of science is totally self-contained. Discoveries in one area find applications in others, often unpredictably. Various notable examples of this involve astronomical studies. Isaac Newton\u2019s laws of motion and gravity ( see also  celestial mechanics: Newton\u2019s laws of motion ) emerged from the analysis of planetary and lunar orbits . Observations during the 1919 solar eclipse provided dramatic confirmation of Albert Einstein \u2019s general theory of relativity , which gained further support with the discovery of the binary pulsar designated PSR 1913+16 and the observation of gravity waves from merging black holes and neutron stars . ( See  relativity: Experimental evidence for general relativity .) The behaviour of nuclear matter and of some elementary particles is now better understood as a result of measurements of neutron stars and the cosmological helium abundance, respectively. Study of the theory of synchrotron radiation was greatly stimulated by the detection of polarized visible radiation emitted by high-energy electrons in the supernova remnant known as the Crab Nebula . Dedicated particle accelerators are now being used to produce synchrotron radiation to probe the structure of solid materials and make detailed X-ray images of tiny samples, including biological structures ( see  spectroscopy: Synchrotron sources ).",
  "Astronomical knowledge also has had a broad impact beyond science. The earliest calendars were based on astronomical observations of the cycles of repeated solar and lunar positions. Also, for centuries, familiarity with the positions and apparent motions of the stars through the seasons enabled sea voyagers to navigate with moderate accuracy. Perhaps the single greatest effect that astronomical studies have had on our modern society has been in molding its perceptions and opinions. Our conceptions of the cosmos and our place in it, our perceptions of space and time, and the development of the systematic pursuit of knowledge known as the scientific method have been profoundly influenced by astronomical observations. In addition, the power of science to provide the basis for accurate predictions of such phenomena as eclipses and the positions of the planets and later, so dramatically, of comets has shaped an attitude toward science that remains an important social force today.",
  "Astronomy was the first natural science to reach a high level of sophistication and predictive ability, which it achieved already in the second half of the 1st millennium bce . The early quantitative success of astronomy, compared with other natural sciences such as physics , chemistry , biology , and meteorology (which were also cultivated in antiquity but which did not reach the same level of accomplishment), stems from several causes. First, the subject matter of early astronomy had the advantage of stability and simplicity\u2014the Sun , the Moon , the planets , and the stars , moving in complex patterns, to be sure, but with great underlying regularity. Biology is far more complicated. Second, the subject was easily mathematized, and already in Greek antiquity astronomy was frequently regarded as a branch of mathematics . This may seem a paradox to a modern reader, since mathematized sciences are regarded as difficult. But in ancient Babylonia and Greece, it was precisely because the motions of the planets could be subjected to mathematical treatment that astronomy made such rapid headway. By contrast, physics failed to make great gains until the 17th century, when its subject matter finally was successfully mathematized. And third, astronomy benefited from its close connection with religion and philosophy , which provided a social value that other sciences simply could not match.",
  "The astronomical tradition is of impressive duration and continuity. A few Babylonian observations of Venus are preserved from the early 2nd millennium bce , and the Babylonians brought their science to a high level by the 4th century bce . For the next half millennium, the greatest headway was made by Greek astronomers, who put their own stamp on the subject but who built on what the Babylonians had accomplished. In the early Middle Ages the leading language of astronomical learning was Arabic, as Greek had been before. Astronomers in Islamic lands mastered what the Greeks had accomplished and soon added to it. With the revival of learning in Europe, and the European Renaissance , the leading language of astronomy became Latin . The European astronomers drew first on Greek astronomy, as translated from Arabic, before acquiring direct access to the classics of Greek science. Thus, modern astronomy is part of a continuous tradition, now almost 4,000 years long, that cuts across multiple cultures and languages. This article focuses on this central story line.",
  "In doing so, there is regrettably little space for other fascinating branches of the history of astronomy. New World astronomy, for example, developed in complete independence but did not rise to so advanced a level. In China astronomy developed to a much higher level, but there too (despite intermittent contacts with Islamic and Indian astronomy and even a fascinating hint of Babylonian influence in the Chinese reckoning of days in 60-day intervals) the story is largely a separate one. That changed with the 16th- and 17th-century Jesuit missions to China, which brought European and Chinese astronomy into direct contact. In India too astronomy reached a high level, involving original Indian methods as well as Indian adaptations of Babylonian and Greek methods, often obtained through Persian contacts. All these branches of the history of astronomy are fascinating and fully merit their own account, but they do not form a part of the main story line of this article.",
  "In the French Maritime Alps , in the Vall\u00e9e des Merveilles (about 100 km [60 miles] north of Nice), are thousands of petroglyphs dating from the Bronze Age ( c. 2900\u20131800 bce ). The culture left images of the objects that concerned it\u2014horned animals, the weapons used to hunt them, and so on. There is one clear image of the Sun \u2014a circle with rays coming from it\u2014and, more controversially, archaeologists have identified two images of the star group known as the Pleiades , represented here perhaps by clusters of small cupules carved into the rock. The sky disk of Nebra, a circular bronze plate with areas of applied gold foil, is much clearer as astronomical imagery. It was found in Saxony-Anhalt , Germany, and dates from about 1600 bce . Its golden images include the crescent Moon , probably the Sun (or perhaps the full Moon), and a cluster of seven small gold dots that almost certainly do represent the Pleiades.",
  "  Astronomical connections are apparent in a number of prehistoric monuments and graves. In several Stone Age cultures, burial chambers often faced east. Stonehenge ( c. 3000\u20131520 bce ) was aligned so that its principal axis coincided with the direction of sunrise on summer solstice . Some other astronomical alignments in Stonehenge, such as with the Moon\u2019s most southerly rising and most northerly setting point, are accepted by many archaeoastronomers. However, most discount some of the more extravagant claims\u2014e.g., that Stonehenge functioned as an eclipse predictor.",
  "That prehistoric people should have noticed and kept track of the Sun and the Moon is not astonishing, but because they lived before writing, the meanings that they attached to celestial events are bound to remain obscure. Some early work in archaeoastronomy was harmed by too great a reliance on conjecture, but methods have greatly improved. Modern archaeoastronomers realize that, with enough stones to work with, one can always find some alignment that is correlated with something celestial. Therefore, one must be careful to perform adequate statistical tests to make sure the alignments are significant and not just accidental.",
  "The earliest sophisticated astronomy arose in ancient Babylonia , in central Mesopotamia , and there are three reasons why it happened there rather than, say, in ancient Greece . First, in Babylonia astronomy had an important social function: the gods sent signs from heaven to warn the king about impending war, a bad barley harvest, or an impending epidemic. In the early 2nd millennium bce , the pattern of taking celestial omens was already established. This was long before the rise of personal astrology ; whereas common people might have taken signs from their surroundings\u2014for example, by observing the behaviour of animals\u2014the celestial signs were intended for the king and kingdom alone. The Greeks were no less superstitious than any other ancient people and saw omens in the flight of birds , in dreams, or in the frenzied utterances of an oracle, but they had no early custom of celestial divination. That came later, in the Hellenistic period, after contact with Babylonian wisdom. Second, there was in Babylonia a civil service charged with things astronomical. Temple scribes, who were often priests, watched the sky every night to keep track of what transpired, and they recorded their observations. Third, in Mesopotamia there existed a stable technology for recording data\u2014the clay tablet. As long as they are protected from water, clay tablets are practically indestructible. The acquired data also had a secure place for storage (the temples), and broken tablets were recopied. All of these circumstances\u2014a social function, a bureaucracy charged with doing astronomy, and a secure system for data storage\u2014were missing in the early Greek world.",
  "By the 7th century bce , astronomical diaries were in existence. These recorded the results of night-by-night watching by the temple astronomers, such as when a planet passed by the Pleiades or another reference star, when Venus reemerged from its period of invisibility (after having been too near the Sun), or when Jupiter stood still and went into retrograde motion (that is, reversed direction). These ancient Babylonian observations were not very precise, but it is far more important to have a long run of observations than to have precise ones.",
  "Within a few generations, Babylonian astronomers had achieved the ability to predict the behaviour of the Moon and the planets. Though no planet repeats its motion from one year to the next, repetition does occur if one waits long enough. For example, Venus does not go into retrograde in the same month or in the same sign of the zodiac from one retrogradation to the next. The pattern does not repeat until after 5 complete retrograde cycles, which take about 8 years. Similarly, Mars starts a new repeating pattern of retrogradations after 22 cycles (which take 47 years), and Saturn repeats its pattern after 57 retrogradations (59 years). This discovery gave rise to the Babylonian goal-year texts. Supposing that one wanted to predict the behaviour of all the planets for the year 2025, which would be the goal year, one could look back in the records and find what Venus had done in 2017 (8 years earlier), what Mars had done in 1978 (47 years earlier), and so on. Thus, the first predictive planetary astronomy was achieved with a good database by making use of repeating patterns.",
  "By about 300 bce the temple scribes achieved a far more sophisticated method of predicting planetary behaviour on the basis of complex arithmetical theories. For each planet there are several different versions of the planetary theory preserved. The basic idea was that a key event, such as the onset of retrogradation, could be thought of as an object in its own right that worked its way around the zodiac. For example, in one version of the Babylonian theory, Jupiter\u2019s onsets of retrograde motion were spaced at regular intervals of 30\u00b0 though about half the zodiac (in Jupiter\u2019s slow zone) but at 36\u00b0 intervals in the remainder of the zodiac (Jupiter\u2019s fast zone). A scribe could use this theory to rapidly work out the dates and positions in the zodiac of the onsets of Jupiter\u2019s retrograde motion for a century or more.",
  "Astronomy is present from the beginning of Greek literature. In Homer \u2019s Iliad and Odyssey , stars and constellations are mentioned, including Orion , the Great Bear ( Ursa Major ), Bo\u00f6tes , Sirius , and the Pleiades . More-detailed astronomical knowledge is found in Hesiod \u2019s Works and Days , from perhaps a generation later than Homer. Hesiod used the appearances and disappearances of important fixed stars in the course of the annual cycle in order to prescribe the work to be done around the farm or the seasons for safe sailing. Much of the astronomical knowledge in Hesiod paralleled the knowledge of the contemporary Babylonians, but the Greeks were substantially less advanced.",
  "  The breakthrough that gave Greek astronomy its own particular character was the application of geometry to cosmic problems. The oldest extant source that clearly states that Earth is a sphere and that gives a sound argument to support the claim is Aristotle \u2019s On the Heavens ( c. 350 bce ), but this knowledge likely went back several generations earlier. Aristotle mentioned that Earth\u2019s shadow as seen on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is circular. He also mentioned the changes that occur in the stars that are visible as one moves from north to south on Earth. Aristotle stated that certain mathematicians had contrived to measure Earth\u2019s circumference and had found a value of 400,000 stades . Although stades of several different lengths were in use, a typical stade was about 0.18 km (0.11 mile), which means that a value for Earth\u2019s circumference was about 72,000 km (44,000 miles). (The true value is 40,075 km [24,902 miles].) Although it is not known who made the first such measurement, Aristotle may have been referring to Eudoxus of Cnidus , whom Aristotle knew in Athens and who wrote a book (now lost) called The Circuit of the Earth .",
  " l l R R l R  The famous measurement by Eratosthenes (the oldest measurement of the size of Earth for which details survive) was made in the 3rd century bce . Eratosthenes used the fact that at noon on the summer solstice , the Sun was directly overhead in Syene (a town on the upper Nile, at modern Aswan , Egypt), but in Alexandria on the same day, the Sun was below the vertical by about one-fiftieth of a circle (7.2\u00b0). This, together with an estimate of 5,000 stades for the distance between Alexandria and Syene, gave a value of 50 \u00d7 5,000 = 250,000 stades (about 45,000 km, or 28,000 miles) for the circumference of Earth, a figure that was roughly correct, regardless of the exact value of Eratosthenes\u2019 stade.",
  "Also in the 3rd century bce , Aristarchus of Samos applied geometrical reasoning to estimate the distances of the Sun and the Moon, in On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon . However, his initial premises included several questionable numerical values. For example, he assumed that at the moment of quarter Moon, the angle between the Sun and the Moon, as observed from Earth, is 87\u00b0. From this it followed that the Sun\u2019s distance is about 19 times the Moon\u2019s distance from us. (The actual ratio is about 389.) A second doubtful observation was that the angular size of the Sun or the Moon is 2\u00b0 (the actual value is about 0.5\u00b0). Although the numerical inputs were flawed, Aristarchus\u2019s method was valid. He found the Moon\u2019s diameter to be between 0.32 and 0.4 times the diameter of Earth, and the Sun\u2019s diameter to be between 6.3 and 7.2 times the diameter of Earth. (The diameters of the Moon and the Sun compared with that of Earth are actually 0.27 and 109, respectively.) By the time of Hipparchus of Bithynia (2nd century bce ), improvements on Aristarchus\u2019s method had led to excellent values for the size and distance of the Moon. But the ancients always considerably underestimated the size and distance of the Sun, which is so far from Earth that a measurement of its parallax lay beyond the powers of naked-eye astronomy. Aristarchus\u2019s 19-to-1 ratio was not called seriously into question until the 17th century.",
  "Greek thinking about the motion of the planets began by about 400 bce . Eudoxus of Cnidus constructed the first Greek theory of planetary motion of which any details are known. In a book, On Speeds (which is lost but was briefly discussed by Aristotle and Simplicius ), Eudoxus regarded each celestial body as carried on a set of concentric spheres, which nest one inside another. For each planet, three different motions must be accounted for, and Eudoxus proposed to do this with four spheres. The daily revolution to the west is accounted for by the outermost sphere (1). Next inside is sphere 2, whose axle fits into sphere 1 at an offset of about 24\u00b0; sphere 2 turns to the east in the planet\u2019s zodiacal period (12 years for Jupiter , 30 years for Saturn ). The third motion is retrograde motion. For this, Eudoxus used a combination of two spheres (3 and 4). The planet itself rides on the equator circle of sphere 4. The axle of 4 fits inside sphere 3 with a slight angular offset. Spheres 3 and 4 turn in opposite directions but at the same speed. The motion of the planet resulting from the gyrations of spheres 3 and 4 is a figure eight, which lies in the spherical surface. Eudoxus likely understood the mathematical characteristics of this curve, as he gave it the name hippopede (horse fetter). The two-sphere assembly of 3 and 4 is inserted into the inner surface of sphere 2. Thus, all three motions are accounted for, at least qualitatively: the daily motion to the west by sphere 1, the slow motion eastward around the zodiac by sphere 2, and the occasional retrograde motion by the two-sphere assembly of 3 and 4. Eudoxus\u2019s theory is sometimes called the theory of homocentric spheres, as all the spheres have the same centre, Earth.",
  "At this stage, Greek astronomers were more interested in providing plausible physical accounts of the universe and in proving geometrical theorems than in providing numerically accurate descriptions of planetary motion. Eudoxus\u2019s successor Callippus made some improvements to the model. Nevertheless, the homocentric spheres were criticized for their failure to account for the fact that some planets (notably Mars and Venus ) are much brighter at some times of their cycles than at others. Eudoxus\u2019s system was soon abandoned as a theory for the motion of the planets, but it exerted a profound influence in cosmology, for the cosmos continued to be regarded as a set of concentric spheres until the Renaissance .",
  "Late in the 3rd century bce , alternative theoretical models were developed, based on eccentric circles and epicycles. (An eccentric circle is a circle that is slightly off-centre from Earth , and an epicycle is a circle that is carried and rides around on another circle.) This innovation is usually attributed to Apollonius of Perga ( c. 220 bce ), but it is not conclusively known who first proposed these models. In considering the Sun\u2019s motion, Eudoxus\u2019s theory of homocentric spheres ignored the fact that the Sun appears to speed up and slow down in the course of the year as it moves around the zodiac . (This is clear from spring\u2019s being several days longer than fall.) An eccentric (i.e., off-centre) circle can explain this fact. The Sun is still considered to travel at constant speed around a perfect circle, but the centre of the circle is slightly displaced from Earth. When the Sun is closest to Earth, it appears to travel a little more rapidly in the zodiac. When it is farthest away, it appears to travel a little more slowly. As far as is known, Hipparchus was the first to deduce the amount and direction of the off-centredness, basing his calculations on the measured length of the seasons . According to Hipparchus, the off-centredness of the Sun\u2019s circle is about 4 percent of its radius. The eccentric-circle theory was capable of excellent accuracy in accounting for the observed motion of the Sun and remained standard until the 17th century.",
  "The standard theory of the planets involved an eccentric circle, which carried an epicycle. Imagine looking down on the plane of the solar system from above its north pole. The planet moves counterclockwise on its epicycle. Meanwhile, the centre of the epicycle moves counterclockwise around the eccentric circle, which is centred near (but not quite exactly at) Earth. As viewed from Earth, the planet will appear to move backward (that is, go into retrograde motion) when it is at the inner part of the epicycle (closest to Earth), for this is when the westward motion of the planet on the epicycle is more than enough to overcome the eastward motion of the epicycle\u2019s centre forward around the eccentric.",
  "Hipparchus played a major role in introducing Babylonian numerical parameters into Greek astronomy. Indeed, an important shift in Greek attitudes toward astronomy occurred about this time. The Babylonian example served as a sort of wake-up call to the Greeks. Previous Greek planetary thinking had been more about getting the right big picture, based on philosophical principles and geometrical models (whether using Eudoxus\u2019s concentric spheres or Apollonius\u2019s epicycles and eccentrics). The Babylonians had no geometrical models but instead focused on devising arithmetical theories that had real predictive power. Hipparchus achieved numerically successful geometrical theories for the Sun and the Moon, but he did not succeed with the planets . He contented himself with showing that the planetary theories then in circulation did not agree with the phenomena. Nevertheless, Hipparchus\u2019s insistence that a geometrical theory, if it is true, ought to work in detail marked a major step in Greek astronomy.",
  "Another of Hipparchus\u2019s contributions was the discovery of precession , the slow eastward motion of the stars around the zodiac caused by wobbling, over a period of 25,772 years, in the orientation of Earth\u2019s axis of rotation. Hipparchus\u2019s writings on this subject have not survived, but his ideas can be reconstructed from summaries given by Ptolemy . Hipparchus used observations of several fixed stars, taken with respect to the eclipsed Moon, which had been made by some of his predecessors. On comparing these with eclipse observations he had made himself, he deduced that the fixed stars move eastward not less than 1\u00b0 in 100 years. The Babylonians , in their theories, revised their locations of the equinoxes and solstices. For example, in one version of the Babylonian theory, the spring equinox is said to occur at the 10th degree of Aries ; in another version, at the 8th degree. Some historians have maintained that this reflects a Babylonian awareness of precession, on which Hipparchus might have drawn. Other historians have argued that the evidence is not clear and that these differing norms for the equinox may represent nothing more than alternative conventions.",
  "  The culminating work of Greek astronomy is the Almagest of Claudius Ptolemaeus (2nd century ce ). Ptolemy built on the work of his predecessors\u2014notably Hipparchus \u2014but his work was so successful that it made older works of planetary astronomy superfluous, and they ceased to be read and copied. An innovation that appears for the first time in the Almagest is the equant point. As in the planetary theories of Hipparchus\u2019s day, a planet travels uniformly around its epicycle while the centre of the epicycle moves around Earth on an off-centre circle. But in Ptolemy\u2019s theory the motion of the epicycle\u2019s centre is nonuniform\u2014it speeds up and slows down\u2014which was a radical departure from Aristotelian physics. However, the nonuniformity is expressed in the language of uniformity: the epicycle\u2019s centre moves in such a way that it appears to go through equal angles in equal times as viewed from another point distinct from Earth, the equant point. Though this may seem like an unnecessary complication, it was just what an explanation of planetary motion required (for, in the modern view, planets really do move nonuniformly). In Ptolemy, for the first time, Greek geometrical planetary theory finally achieved real numerical accuracy. Ptolemy\u2019s theory actually predicted the behaviour of the planets, and it dominated the practice of astronomy for 1,400 years.",
  "The Almagest contains an account of the observations and a description of the mathematical procedures that Ptolemy used to deduce the parameters of his theories. It also provides tables that allow the user to work out the position of a planet from theory for any desired date. The advantage of the tables is that Ptolemy has done all the trigonometry . One need only follow Ptolemy\u2019s precepts, take numbers out of the various tables, and combine them to get an answer for a planet\u2019s position. The Almagest includes trigonometric tables and a catalog of about 1,000 stars , which was probably based substantially on an earlier catalog by Hipparchus but with additions and modifications by Ptolemy. It also contains Ptolemy\u2019s improvement on Hipparchus\u2019s lunar theory. As an aid to convenient calculation, Ptolemy also composed the Procheiroi kanones ( Handy Tables ), in which the astronomical tables of the Almagest were expanded and accompanied by directions for using them but were stripped of the theoretical discussion.",
  "Historians have long debated how much credit to give Ptolemy and how much to assign to his predecessors. For an ancient scientist, he was unusually generous in crediting his predecessors, particularly Hipparchus, for discoveries. But he did not always mention the origin of his ideas. In any case, Ptolemy\u2019s publications fundamentally changed the way astronomy was done in the Greek world . In the period between Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Greek astronomers had struggled without great success to make geometrical planetary theory work. From the evidence of Greek-inspired astronomical works that later turned up in India, it has been conjectured that Greek astronomers before Ptolemy may have experimented with nonuniform motion\u2014something akin to the equant\u2014but nothing remains of a finished project before Ptolemy.",
  "The garbage dumps of Oxyrhynchus in Greek Egypt have yielded large quantities of papyri , including planetary tables used for computing horoscopes. Most of this material is from the 1st through the 4th century ce . The papyri show the astrologers of Greek Egypt happily using Greek versions of Babylonian arithmetical theories for computing planet positions. This material is found side by side with papyri based on Ptolemy\u2019s Handy Tables . Thus, in Greek astronomy there was a high road based on philosophy of nature and rooted in geometrical methods, and there was a low road based on the convenient arithmetical methods adapted from the Babylonians, even if these could not be considered to rest on adequate physical or philosophical foundations. These two methods still existed side by side up to the time of Ptolemy, and even a little after, but the newly successful (and convenient) geometrical methods gradually won out.",
  "Ptolemy also wrote a speculative cosmological work, the Hypotheseis ton planomenon ( Planetary Hypotheses ), in which he took the eccentric-and-epicycle astronomy of the Almagest as physically true. However, to give a satisfactory image of the cosmos, he needed the nested-spheres cosmology of Eudoxus. The eccentrics and epicycles were regarded as the equator circles of three-dimensional orbs. Assuming that there was no wasted or empty space in the cosmos (consistent with both Aristotelian and Stoic physics), Ptolemy supposed that the mechanism for Mercury must lie immediately above the mechanism for the Moon . The mechanism for Venus came next, and so on, out to the mechanism for Saturn , and finally the sphere of the fixed stars. (Historians are not all agreed on whether the ancients regarded these mechanisms as real, physical objects that moved the planets or as merely theoretical constructions, but Ptolemy probably considered them as real things.) The known distance of the Moon provided the scale. When the numbers were worked out, the distance of the fixed stars was about 20,000 Earth radii. This is an enormous cosmos (though much smaller than modern estimates). Accepting such a conclusion, based on planetary astronomy and a few auxiliary physical premises, required a certain courage of imagination.",
  " Ptolemy was the last major figure in the Greek astronomical tradition. Commentaries were written on his works by Pappus of Alexandria in the 3rd century ce and by Theon of Alexandria and his daughter, Hypatia , in the 4th, but creative work was no longer being done. Babylonian astronomy traveled eastward into Persia and India, where it was adapted in original ways and combined with native Indian methods. Greek geometrical planetary theories, from the time between Hipparchus and Ptolemy , also made their way into India. This material is of great complexity and variety and is difficult to sort out. For example, Babylonian arithmetical procedures used for computing lunar and solar phenomena turn up in conjunction with a length for the solar year due to Hipparchus. Nevertheless, the Indian material, besides its own intrinsic interest, provides information about Greek astronomy during a vital period about which the Classical texts say little.",
  "In the 8th century, Arabic Muslim astronomers came into contact with this complicated astronomical material. Theories and methods that had passed from the Babylonians and Greeks through Persia to India now came back to the West. A good example is provided by the z\u012bj of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (9th century). Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b\u2019s work is a confusing mixture of Indian, Persian, and Greek tables and techniques, but it helped establish an important genre of the z\u012bj . A z\u012bj is a handbook of astronomical tables, including tables for working out positions of the Sun , Moon , and planets , accompanied by directions for using them. The ancient prototype was Ptolemy\u2019s Handy Tables .",
  "Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest was translated on at least four occasions into Arabic. Much of the translation activity centred on the Baghdad caliphate of the \u02bfAbb\u0101sids (750\u20131258). With the pure geometrical form of Greek planetary theory now available, Arabic astronomers worked to master it and then to improve upon it. The z\u012bj of al-Batt\u0101n\u012b (early 10th century ce ) showed mastery of Ptolemaic planetary theory and improved values for some of Ptolemy\u2019s parameters, such as the magnitude and direction of the Sun\u2019s eccentricity. Hundreds of Arabic z\u012bj es from the 9th to the 15th century have been preserved. Some were based on Indian methods, but the great majority were in the tradition of the Almagest and the Handy Tables . A z\u012bj that was very influential in the development of European astronomy was the Toledan Tables , compiled in Spain by a group of Muslim and Jewish astronomers, put into final form by Ibn al-Zarqallu around 1080, and translated into Latin soon after. (The Toledan Tables are mentioned by Chaucer in The Canterbury Tales .)",
  "With the passage of time, it became possible for astronomers to make new discoveries, including those that depended on detecting slow changes in the heavens. In the 9th century the Baghdad astronomers observed that the obliquity of the ecliptic had decreased from the value given in Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest . The obliquity of the ecliptic is the angle between the celestial equator and the tropic of Cancer . It corresponds to the northward displacement of the Sun between the equinox and the summer solstice and can be measured by means of noon altitudes of the Sun taken at key times of the year. Between Ptolemy\u2019s time and the present day, the obliquity of the ecliptic has decreased by about a quarter of a degree. Arabic astronomers also noted that the seasons had changed slightly in length from the values recorded by Ptolemy. This implied that the solar apogee has a slow motion to the east. Thus, the centre of the Sun\u2019s circle can be regarded as revolving very slowly about Earth. This motion was represented in al-Batt\u0101n\u012b\u2019s z\u012bj .",
  "Ptolemy\u2019s planetary theory was criticized, but minor disagreements between Ptolemy\u2019s tables and actual observations of the planets did not play a significant role in this criticism. Most of the criticism centred on Ptolemy\u2019s violation of the Aristotelian principle of the uniformity of the celestial motions. About 1000 ce  Ibn al-Haytham criticized the equant point in Shuk\u016bk \u02bfal\u0101 Ba\u1e6dlamy\u016bs (\u201cDoubts About Ptolemy\u201d). Ibn al-Haytham also objected to Ptolemy\u2019s habit of defining motions with respect to immaterial points and lines as if they were real material bodies. (Complaints about the artificiality of Ptolemy\u2019s constructions had been made even in late antiquity\u2014for example, by the Greek philosopher Proclus in his Diadochi hypotyposis astronomicarum positionum [\u201cSketch of Astronomical Hypotheses\u201d].)",
  "Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s doubts about Ptolemaic planetary theory inspired some creative mathematical modeling by 13th-century astronomers associated with the observatory of Mar\u0101gheh (now in Azerbaijan). Na\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b described a construction through which two circular motions can give rise to the oscillation of a point back and forth along a straight line. Ptolemy\u2019s theories of Mercury and of the Moon involved oscillatory movements for which the standard mechanisms seemed philosophically questionable. Al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b applied his two-circle mechanism (called an \u201cal-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b couple\u201d by modern scholars) to produce the same phenomena in what seemed to him a physically more plausible way. Al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b\u2019s student al-Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b went farther, using a minor epicycle to eliminate the need for an equant point. In the 14th century Ibn al-Sh\u0101\u1e6dir of Damascus built on the works of the Mar\u0101gheh school in his Nih\u0101yat al-su\u02bel fi ta\u1e63\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 al-u\u1e63\u016bl (\u201cFinal Inquiry Concerning the Rectification of Planetary Theory\u201d), which was also characterized by the elimination of nonuniform motions in favour of minor epicycles. However, these efforts did not transform common practice, since the overwhelming majority of late medieval planetary tables are Ptolemaic in their underlying theory. In the 16th century Nicolaus Copernicus used models identical to those of Ibn al-Sh\u0101\u1e6dir and the Mar\u0101gheh school. How he came by them is unknown, but there are too many of them to make independent discovery credible. These technical \u201cimprovements\u201d on Ptolemy had nothing to do with the heliocentric hypothesis, but they show that Copernicus was heir to a tradition of critical engagement with Ptolemy.",
  "In the Latin West the level of scientific learning had sunk to a low level. None of the Greek works most important for ancient astronomy and cosmology\u2014 Aristotle \u2019s On the Heavens and Ptolemy \u2019s Almagest , Handy Tables , and Planetary Hypotheses \u2014were available. The teaching of astronomy was based on a number of low-level Latin accounts. Book II of Pliny the Elder \u2019s Naturalis historia ( Natural History , 1st century ce ) contained a summary of astronomical matters. In the 4th century Martianus Capella wrote an allegorical poem, De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii ( The Marriage of Philology and Mercury ). In the two introductory books, Philology, personified as a maiden, is wed to Mercury , patron god of learning. In the following seven books, each of the Liberal Arts , including Astronomy, personified as a handmaid to Philology, steps forward to give an account of her art. Martianus\u2019s Marriage was widely admired in the early Middle Ages as a compendium of all useful learning.",
  "In the 12th and 13th centuries, two developments were key to the revival of astronomy in the Latin West. The translation movement rapidly made available key works of Greek astronomy that had long been out of reach. One of the most important translators was Gerard of Cremona . As his students later wrote of him, he had learned everything that was known to the Latins, but for love of the Almagest , which he had heard of but which was unavailable in Latin, he went to Spain and learned Arabic well enough to translate it. Thus, one could maintain that a major reason for the revival of learning in the West was one man\u2019s desire to be able to read Ptolemy. Gerard translated from Arabic versions not only Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest but also Aristotle\u2019s On the Heavens , Euclid \u2019s Elements , and about two dozen other works of astronomy and geometry . In a single generation most of the key works of ancient astronomy became available.",
  "The second important development was the foundation of the European universities , starting with those of Bologna , Paris , and Oxford . Because astronomy figured among the liberal arts, it had a place in the university core curriculum. Of course, the astronomy of the liberal arts curriculum was at a rudimentary level. The students might be taken though an introduction to the celestial sphere \u2014for example, the De sphaera mundi (\u201cOn the Sphere of the World,\u201d c. 1230) by Johannes de Sacrobosco, which might be followed by the anonymous Theorica planetarum (\u201cTheories of the Planets\u201d), a superficial introduction to eccentrics and epicycles. Nevertheless, in every university town there had to be someone charged with teaching astronomy.",
  "In the 1270s a new set of astronomical tables was compiled in Spain under the patronage of the Christian king Alfonso X of L\u00e9on and Castile. These were based on standard Ptolemaic astronomy, with some differences in the treatment of precession (now considered to occur at a variable speed). By 1320 the  Alfonsine Tables  had reached Paris, where they were reworked by several Parisian astronomers. From there they spread all over Latin Europe, and for more than two centuries they were the standard.",
  "Though \u201coracle bones\u201d exist from the late 2nd millennium bce that mention observations of lunar and solar eclipses as well as the appearance of a new star ( nova ), astronomical reports begin to be fairly numerous only from about 200 bce . In China astronomy had an imperial function. The emperor was considered the Son of Heaven. Thus, the regulation of the calendar, as well as the success or failure of his astronomers to predict an eclipse, reflected either well or badly on him. Many different astronomical summaries were written in conjunction with the ascent of a new emperor. Usually these emphasized the lunisolar calendar, but later they also included tables for predicting the motions of the planets , as well as eclipses. Chinese predictive astronomy used repeating arithmetical cycles and was thus more like Babylonian astronomy than like Greek astronomy. Perhaps because the Chinese were less tied up with cosmological theories and \u201claws\u201d of nature than the Greeks and their medieval European successors were, the Chinese astronomers were much more interested in singular events, such as comets , novae, meteor showers , solar eclipses, and sunspots (which the Chinese discovered before the Europeans), and they kept detailed records of them.",
  "European astronomy regained the level of the ancient Greeks only with the publication in 1496 of Epytoma in Almagestum Ptolemaei (\u201cEpitome of Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest \u201d) begun by mathematician and astronomer Georg von Peuerbach and completed by his student Regiomontanus (the Latin name of Johannes M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigsberg). Regiomontanus\u2019s chapter-by-chapter commentary helped the next couple of generations learn their Ptolemy . He sometimes criticized Ptolemy\u2014for example, pointing out that the twofold variation in the distance of the Moon implied by Ptolemy\u2019s lunar theory greatly exceeded the variation in distance implied by the Moon\u2019s variation in apparent size. Although this variation had been known in Arabic astronomy, this was its first mention in the Latin West.",
  "Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus announced the motion of Earth in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium libri VI (\u201cSix Books Concerning the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs,\u201d 1543). (An early sketch of his heliocentric theory, the Commentariolus , had circulated in manuscript in the small astronomical community of central Europe from about 1510, but it was not printed until the 19th century.) Although Copernicus made some new observations of the planets and drew on some observations by his medieval predecessors, new observations played no important role in his discovery. Rather, Copernicus discovered the motion of Earth by understanding Ptolemy more deeply than anyone else had\u2014for the essential clues lay there in the Almagest for all to see.",
  "Each planet\u2019s motion is connected with the motion of the Sun . The inferior planets are always the close companions of the Sun. Mercury never gets more than about 22\u00b0 from the Sun, and Venus never more than about 48\u00b0. This can be explained simply by imagining that these two planets circle the Sun.",
  "For the superior planets ( Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn ), the connection is more subtle. Each of these planets goes into retrograde motion when it is diametrically opposite the Sun as viewed from Earth. In the ancient planetary theory, this required the three planets to move around their epicycles in lockstep with one another and with the motion of the Sun around Earth. In the case of Mars, for example, the revolving line from the epicycle\u2019s centre to Mars must remain parallel to the revolving line from Earth to the Sun. The same holds true for Jupiter and Saturn. Ptolemy mentioned that one could use this fact to avoid duplicated calculations if one wanted to work out the positions of all three planets for the same date. Copernicus\u2019s great insight was that these four simultaneous motions were really manifestations of one single motion\u2014the motion of Earth itself.",
  "The early reaction to Copernicus was rather muted, and astronomers had several different kinds of response. One could admire Copernicus\u2019s mathematical abilities and simply remain agnostic on the question of Earth\u2019s motion. Such, for example, was the position of German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold, who wrote a popular textbook of Ptolemaic astronomy but who also computed and published the Prutenic Tables , based on Copernicus\u2019s planetary theory, which helped boost Copernicus\u2019s reputation.",
  "Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe was a good example of those who admired Copernicus\u2019s achievement in tying all the motions of the planets more closely to the Sun but who were unable to accept the motion of Earth. Brahe worked out an alternative cosmology, known as the Tychonic system . In this view the Moon and the Sun revolve around Earth, but all of the other planets revolve around the moving Sun. Tycho\u2019s system had the same explanatory advantages as Copernicus\u2019s. It was what the Copernican system would look like if Earth was made to stay at rest.",
  "Like many other astronomers, Tycho was fascinated by the brilliant new star that appeared in Cassiopeia in 1572. He made extensive observations to determine if it shifted its position with respect to neighbouring stars from night to night. For an astronomer or a philosopher of an Aristotelian frame of mind, it would be difficult to admit that a new star really could appear in the heavens; one would more likely consider it to be some sort of phenomenon in the upper reaches of the air and fire (the elements that, in Aristotle \u2019s cosmology, surround Earth and the seas). If the new star displayed a parallax (i.e., if it shifted back and forth with respect to the real stars), one could be sure that it was near Earth and not a part of the cosmic sphere. Tycho\u2019s demonstration that the new star had no measurable parallax and that it therefore really was a star in the celestial sphere did much to dismantle the old physics.",
  "In 1577 there was a second gift from heaven\u2014a particularly bright comet . In antiquity and the Middle Ages, comets were regarded as atmospheric phenomena. Thus, Aristotle did not treat them in On the Heavens but rather treated them in Meteorology . After all, they are transient, appear suddenly, rapidly cross from one constellation to another, and then disappear. However, Tycho was able to model the motion of the comet by putting it into an orbit around the Sun. He pointed out that the comet was therefore sometimes closer to Earth, and sometimes farther away, than Venus and Mercury were. This seemed to imply that it crashed through the celestial spheres that carried these planets, thus calling into question these vast constructions.",
  "In 1609 Italian scientist Galileo Galilei , using his own telescope , modeled on an invention recently made in the Netherlands, discovered that the Moon , far from being smooth and utterly unlike Earth, had mountains and craters. By using the lengths of their shadows, Galileo was even able to measure the heights of the Moon\u2019s mountains. A number of nebulae resolved into swarms of individual small stars. Even the Milky Way was made of stars. Perhaps the most exciting find was the discovery of four moons revolving about Jupiter. These discoveries were announced in Galileo\u2019s Sidereus Nuncius ( The Sidereal Messenger , 1610), the book that made his reputation. Although none of these discoveries directly supported the Copernican theory, they all lent indirect support in that they made the new cosmology less objectionable. That Jupiter has satellites cannot prove that Earth goes around the Sun , but it showed that there was at least one other centre of revolution than Earth. It also showed that a moving planet could carry its satellites along with it (as Earth does the Moon in the Copernican view). The later discovery that Venus ran through a complete set of phases like the Moon definitely ruled out the Ptolemaic idea that Venus lay below the solar sphere, but it did not rule out a theory like Tycho Brahe\u2019s, in which Venus circled the Sun while the Sun moved around Earth.",
  "In 1616 the Roman Catholic Church placed Copernicus\u2019s De revolutionibus on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Forbidden Books). In 1618 a list was issued of 10 specific corrections\u2014passages dealing with Earth\u2019s motion that were to be struck out. But outside Italy, this order was rarely followed. One curious exception can be mentioned. Jesuit missionaries to China in the late 16th and early 17th centuries carried European astronomy with them. The Jesuit astronomers were predisposed to the Tychonic system, which kept Earth at the centre of the universe but which otherwise shared the advantages of Copernicanism. After the condemnation of Copernicanism, they had no choice but to keep to the Tychonic system, and they continued to teach it in China long after it had gone out of fashion in Europe.",
  "Galileo, even though he had been warned not to teach Copernicanism as literally true, decided to take advantage of the ascent of a more liberal thinker to the papacy, Pope Urban VII , and gambled on a work of popularization. In Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo, tolemaico e copernicano ( Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Ptolemaic & Copernican , 1632), three friends\u2014an avowed follower of Ptolemy and Aristotle, a convinced Copernican, and an intermediary who guided the debate\u2014discuss cosmology and astronomy. Naturally, the Copernican gets the better of the arguments. Galileo was put on trial and forced to recant, but the official condemnation of the book and the trial of Galileo did little to halt the advance of the new ideas.",
  "  German astronomer Johannes Kepler embraced Copernicanism wholeheartedly. Nevertheless, he may be considered the last astronomer, and one of the greatest astronomers, in the old tradition\u2014one of the last for whom the Almagest was still a part of the research literature. Kepler had begun with an interest in cosmology, in trying to understand God\u2019s architecture for the solar system. Why, for example, were there six planets rather than some other number? Going back to speculations introduced by Plato and the Pythagoreans , Kepler applied first the geometry of the regular solids and then musical harmonies to explain various aspects of the universe. For example, there were six planets because there were only five regular solids (cube, tetrahedron, etc.), which God had used as spacers between the planetary orbs when working out the cosmic architecture. Kepler\u2019s first book, Mysterium cosmographicum (\u201cCosmographic Mystery,\u201d 1596), was based on this idea. As a result of this book, Kepler received an invitation to work with Tycho Brahe , but nothing happened until 1600, when Tycho left his native Denmark and relocated to Prague under the patronage of the Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II .",
  "Kepler went to Prague, hoping to obtain from Tycho better values of planetary parameters so that he could refine his cosmology. The collaboration lasted only a short time, because Tycho died in 1601. When Kepler arrived in Prague, Tycho and his assistants were involved in observations of Mars , which was then about to make a near approach to Earth. This turned out to be fortunate for Kepler, because only Mars and Mercury have large enough eccentricities to make the departures of their orbits from circularity appreciable and Mercury is too near the Sun to be easily or often observed. After Tycho\u2019s death Kepler gained access to his observation records. Far from being able to find ready results to use in cosmology, Kepler was forced to analyze many observations to put them into usable form.",
  "    P d     Kepler began as a convinced Copernican, so he put the Sun in the middle of his system, but for technical details he went back to Ptolemy. Kepler began by regarding Mars as moving on a circle that was slightly off-centre from the Sun and was following Ptolemy\u2019s equant law. But he was unable to get this theory to match all of Tycho\u2019s observations to better than about 8 minutes of arc (1 minute of arc = 1/60 of a degree), and he believed that Tycho\u2019s observations were good to about 2 minutes of arc. Against his will he was forced to reexamine the fundamentals of planetary motion. This led to the first two of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion , published in Astronomia Nova ( New Astronomy , 1609). According to the first law, the paths of planets are ellipses with one focus located at the Sun. The second law, which was actually discovered first, makes a small improvement on Ptolemy\u2019s equant: a planet moves around the Sun at a variable speed in such a way that the line from the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. In Harmonice Mundi ( The Harmony of the World , 1619), Kepler announced his third, or harmonic, law: the ratio a  3 / T  2 is the same for all planets, where a is the semimajor axis of a planet\u2019s elliptical orbit and T is the orbital period.",
  " Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy  Kepler\u2019s laws received a physical explanation only with the publication of English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton \u2019s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy , 1687). Here Newton announced his laws of motion , as well as the law of universal gravitation : any two particles in the universe attract one another with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton used these laws to rederive Kepler\u2019s laws , thus making planetary theory a branch of physics for the first time in history. He then applied the laws to explain other phenomena, such as the rise and fall of the tides and the orbits of comets .",
  "The law of inertia (Newton\u2019s first law\u2014a body tends to move at constant speed in a straight line) had been hinted at by Galileo and expressed in a more definite way by French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes . The third law (if body A exerts a force on body B, then B exerts force on A equal in magnitude but opposite in direction) was well supported by recent work on collisions by Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens and others. Newton\u2019s second law (the force impressed on a body is equal to the body\u2019s mass times its acceleration) represented a fresh way of thinking about motion. The idea of an inverse-square law for gravity had been toyed with in England by physicist Robert Hooke , architect Sir Christopher Wren , and astronomer Edmond Halley , but they had been unable to assemble all the necessary concepts\u2014the law of attraction, the concept of motion under an impressed force, and the linking mathematics\u2014into a finished product. Newton\u2019s Principia fundamentally altered the intellectual context for the science of astronomy.",
  "Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation encountered some resistance, especially on the French-speaking Continent, where it was sometimes regarded as a falling back into a discredited way of thinking. The idea that one body could reach out across empty space and affect another seemed to some to be a throwback to medieval animism. It did not help that Newton could not explain the mechanism by which gravity acted.",
  "In the first part of the 18th century, the inverse-square law was subjected to several dramatic tests. The first concerned Earth \u2019s shape. Newton had argued that Earth\u2019s rapid rotation on its axis must cause Earth to depart from perfect sphericity. Instead, Earth should be an oblate spheroid\u2014that is, flattened at the poles like an onion. For evidence, Newton pointed to the example of Jupiter , which showed a noticeable flattening when seen through a telescope . Also, in 1672 the French scientist Jean Richer had carefully measured the rate of a pendulum clock near Earth\u2019s Equator (by comparing it with the motion of the stars ) and found that the clock ran slightly slower than an identical clock in Paris. Newton argued that if Earth was flattened at the poles, Paris would be a little closer to Earth\u2019s centre than the Equator would be. If gravity varied as the inverse square of the distance, Earth\u2019s gravity should then be stronger in Paris than at the Equator, and thus the Paris pendulum clock would run faster. But in 1718 Jacques Cassini announced results of a survey of the Paris meridian from Dunkirk to Collioure, made by his father, Gian Domenico Cassini , and himself, that seemed to show just the opposite\u2014that Earth is elongated at the poles like a lemon. French natural philosophers, steeped in the vortex theory of Descartes, found ways of explaining this in terms of Cartesian physics. In the 1730s the French Academy of Sciences sponsored two expeditions\u2014one to Lapland , led by mathematician Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis , and one to equatorial South America\u2014just to settle this question. Careful geodetic and astronomical measurements were made to determine the length of a degree of the meridian for a place near the pole and a place near the Equator. The results of the Lapland expedition showed decisively that Earth was flattened at the poles, as Newton had maintained. Voltaire famously addressed his friend Maupertuis as \u201cthe flattener of the world and of Cassinis.\u201d",
  "Second, Newton had been unable to calculate the correct rate for the advance of the Moon \u2019s perigee\u2014that is, the movement of the point on the Moon\u2019s orbit where it is closest to Earth. The reason for the advance of the perigee lies in the perturbing attraction of the Sun on the Moon, but Newton obtained a rate too small by half (a complete revolution of the perigee takes about 18 years instead of the observed 9). In the 18th century several leading mathematicians tried to solve the problem and failed. In 1747 French mathematician and physicist Alexis-Claude Clairaut proposed a modification of Newton\u2019s law of gravity. Instead of a pure inverse-square law, Clairaut proposed adding a small term, proportional to the inverse fourth power of the distance, in order to get the motion of the Moon\u2019s perigee to come out correctly. Clairaut later withdrew this proposal and showed in a new calculation that the inverse-square law was perfectly adequate for explaining the motion of the Moon\u2019s perigee. The problem was too complex to be solved directly, and it was necessary to introduce approximations. Clairaut showed that the approximations made by Newton and those who followed had been too rash and that with more-careful approximations, the advance of perigee came out just right. This was, by far, the most precise test of the Newtonian theory to date.",
  "  Finally, as the time approached for the expected reappearance of Halley\u2019s Comet , celestial mechanicians undertook a more-precise calculation of the date of return. Halley had argued that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were one and the same and predicted a return for late 1758 or early 1759, but he did not live to see it happen. When the comet, on its very elongated orbit, passes by massive planets , such as Jupiter, on its way out of and back into the inner solar system , the planets exert forces that perturb its motion. In Paris, Clairaut, astronomer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande , and Nicole Lepaut\u00e9, the wife of a well-known instrument maker, calculated the motion of the comet, including the perturbing forces. This was the most ambitious program of numerical integration ever undertaken up to that time. When the comet reappeared within their announced one-month window of error, it was seen by many as a triumph of calculation, as well as of the law of universal gravitation.",
  "Since every planet is attracted not only by the Sun but also (much more weakly) by all the other planets, its orbit cannot really be the simple ellipse described by Kepler . Newton was therefore willing to entertain the idea that God might occasionally need to readjust the planetary system. In the 18th century new mathematical methods were developed, largely in France, to treat perturbations more efficiently. The key figures in this work were Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre-Simon Laplace . They showed that the solar system is inherently quite stable. Each planet is perturbed by the others, but the net result is only oscillatory corrections to the unperturbed orbits; there are no runaway behaviours. God would not need to intervene after all.",
  "Laplace is known mainly for his densely mathematical Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste ( A Treatise of Celestial Mechanics ; 5 vol., 1798\u20131825), but he was also the author of a work of popularization, the Exposition du syst\u00e8me du monde ( The System of the World ), which appeared in several editions between 1796 and 1824. In this work Laplace explained for the lay reader all the phenomena of the solar system in terms of universal gravitation. This was followed by a brief history of astronomy from ancient times down to Laplace\u2019s own day. The book ended with a brief account of what is now called Laplace\u2019s nebular hypothesis , a theory of the origin of the solar system. Laplace imagined that the planets had condensed from the primitive solar atmosphere, which originally extended far beyond the limits of the present-day system. As this cloud gradually contracted under the effects of gravity, it first formed rings and then amalgamated into planets. Newton had seen in the regularities of the solar system a sure sign of the wisdom and beneficence of the Creator. For example, the fact that all the planets travel around the Sun in the same direction and more or less in the same plane could be explained only by divine providence. Laplace, looking at the same facts, instead regarded them as evidence about the prehistory of the solar system. The nebular hypothesis, although only sketchily worked out, was important as an early example of an evolutionary theory in natural science, and it is notable that evolutionary thinking entered astronomy before it became important in the life sciences.",
  "  The foremost observational astronomer of the period was William Herschel . Herschel was born in Hannover, Germany, in 1738, but he moved to England as a young man to avoid the Continental wars. He settled in Bath and made a living as a musician and as a music teacher while devoting all his spare time to amateur astronomy, which he cultivated at a very high level. By making his own telescopes, he soon had finer instruments than anyone else. In 1781, while sweeping the sky for double stars , he spotted a small object that he first took to be either a comet or a nebulous star. Herschel convinced himself that he had discovered a new comet, which would not have been an unusual occurrence, but soon other astronomers demonstrated that it was moving in a nearly circular orbit about the Sun , so it became known as a planet . Angling for royal patronage, Herschel proposed naming the new object Georgium Sidus, the Georgian Star, after King George III . The flattery worked, for Herschel was soon rewarded with an annual pension, which allowed him to give up teaching music and to devote himself almost completely to astronomy. Continental astronomers refused to accept Herschel\u2019s proposed name. In 1783 German astronomer Johann Elert Bode proposed Uranus , the name that eventually stuck.",
  "There was a long tradition that went all the way back to Plato and the Pythagoreans of trying to tie planetary distances to numerical sequences. An influential new scheme was proposed in 1766 by Prussian astronomer Johann Daniel Titius von Wittenberg . According to Titius, the sequence of planetary distances takes the form 4, 4 + 3, 4 + 6, 4 + 12, 4 + 24, 4 + 48, 4 + 96,\u2026 Titius fixed the scale by assigning 100 to Saturn \u2019s distance from the Sun which, indeed, makes Mercury \u2019s distance about 4. Titius pointed out that there is an empty place at distance 28, corresponding to the large gap between Mars and Jupiter , and speculated that this gap would be filled by undiscovered satellites of Mars . Titius had slipped his distance rule, unsigned, into his German translation of Swiss philosopher Charles Bonnet\u2019s Contemplation de la nature ( The Contemplation of Nature , 1764). This sequence of planetary distances was adopted, without credit, by Bode in his Deutliche Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels (\u201cClear Guide to the Starry Heaven\u201d; 2nd ed., 1772). (In later editions Bode did give credit to Titius.) Bode also predicted that a planet would eventually be found at distance 28. Herschel\u2019s discovery of Uranus at distance 192 (where the Titius-Bode sequence predicted 196) seemed an uncanny confirmation of the law.",
  "  Astronomers began to search for a planet in the Mars-Jupiter gap. In 1801 Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered a small planetlike object in the gap, which he named Ceres , after the patron goddess of Sicily. Pallas was discovered by German astronomer Wilhelm Olbers the following year. Herschel did not feel that these objects were large enough to be planets, so he proposed the term  asteroid  (Greek for \u201cstarlike\u201d), which had been suggested to him by classicist Charles Burney, Jr., via his father, music historian Charles Burney, Sr., who was a close friend of Herschel\u2019s. (Later they were also called \u201cminor planets.\u201d Today, after a 2006 ruling by the International Astronomical Union , they are officially designated \u201c dwarf planets \u201d if, like Ceres, they are massive enough to have been rounded to spheres by their own gravity . Most, however, are much smaller and are officially designated \u201csmall solar system bodies,\u201d though many astronomers still informally refer to these as asteroids.)",
  "Although Herschel\u2019s discovery of Uranus made his reputation, it was far from being his most important contribution. During the 18th century, astronomers had measured the proper motions of a reasonably large number of stars . (Proper motion is the slow drift of a star with respect to its neighbours, which slowly causes the constellations to change shape. The first few proper motions were announced in 1718 by Halley , who found them by comparing recently observed star positions with data recorded in Ptolemy \u2019s Almagest .) Herschel noted that many of the stars with substantial proper motions are bright, which suggests that they might be nearby. He reasoned that if there is any pattern in the stellar proper motions, it might be due to the motion of the Sun through the field of stars. In 1783 Herschel published an analysis of 19 proper motions and concluded that the Sun is traveling through space in the direction of the constellation Hercules (toward a point called the solar apex). This was later questioned by the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician Friedrich Bessel , who had many more proper motions to work with, but Herschel\u2019s conclusion was ultimately proved correct.",
  "Herschel was not only an excellent observer but also a remarkably inventive thinker in devising simplifying assumptions that allowed him to make theoretical progress. He was one of several people who in the mid- to late 18th century arrived at the idea that the Milky Way has the form of a flattened disk. However, only Herschel actually tried to deduce the structure of this vast star system. If one had a telescope sufficiently powerful to penetrate to the edge of the Milky Way and aimed the telescope in a direction lying in the plane of the Milky Way, one would look through a region dense with stars. In fact, the number of stars seen in the telescope\u2019s field of view could be taken as a measure of the distance from the Sun to the edge of the Milky Way in that direction. Herschel made a large number of such counts, which he called \u201cstar gages,\u201d and in 1785 drew the first quantitative chart of the Milky Way\u2019s form. Later, when he realized that his telescope had not actually been powerful enough to penetrate to the galaxy\u2019s edge, he abandoned this drawing. But because there was nothing that might replace it, Herschel\u2019s drawing of the form of the Milky Way was frequently reprinted throughout the 19th century.",
  "  Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel expended prodigious time and effort in cataloging the nebulae . A few small nebulous, or cloudlike, patches in the night sky are visible to the naked eye and had been mentioned by ancient Greek and medieval Arabic astronomers. In 1755 German philosopher Immanuel Kant suggested that these nebulae might be vast systems of stars, comparable to the Milky Way. These later came to be called \u201cisland universes,\u201d but at this stage the notion was purely speculative. Nebulae could be troublesome, since astronomers on the lookout for new comets could easily mistake an uncataloged nebula for a comet. In 1771 French astronomer Charles Messier published a list of 45 nebulae to keep himself and other comet searchers from wasting time. In 1784 his list was expanded to 103. These Messier objects are today favourite objects for amateur astronomers. William Herschel received a copy of one of Messier\u2019s lists. Caroline, who swept for comets by using a special telescope that William had made for her, soon noticed nebulae not on Messier\u2019s list. As a consequence, William became interested in nebulae and systematically searched for them while engaged in other observing chores. Over 20 years he raised the number of known nebulae to about 2,500. It had been known since Galileo that through a good telescope, some nebulae could be resolved into stars. Were the nebulae really all star systems at vast distances from Earth , or were there also regions of true nebulosity, clouds of luminous fluid? Recent drawings of the Orion nebula , when compared with a drawing made by Christiaan Huygens in the 17th century, seemed to show that this nebula had changed form, which implied that it had to be close, relatively small, and not made of stars. Herschel\u2019s opinions changed in the course of his career, but he tended to regard nebulae as star systems in the process of evolution toward denser states, with the evolution driven by universal gravitation . Today it is known that \u201cnebulae\u201d come in several kinds: some are clouds of glowing gas; some are clusters of stars ; and some really are galaxies comparable in size to the Milky Way. But this understanding was not possible until the 19th-century development of spectroscopy and the 20th-century measurement of the distance to another galaxy.",
  "Herschel was unusual among the astronomers of his day, because he concerned himself with the larger construction of the heavens and was far less interested in the ordinary business of professional astronomy, which meant making exactingly accurate position measurements. Herschel helped to open the road to a new physical astronomy that really came into its own only in the 20th century. Nevertheless, there were important discoveries to be made with the old style of astronomy, conducted at universities or sponsored by national observatories, ostensibly because of its application to navigation .",
  "English astronomer James Bradley was perhaps the most significant of the old-style 18th-century observers. High-precision measurements of star positions that he made in the 1720s led him to the discovery of the aberration of starlight . It had been known since the late 17th century that light has a finite speed. Danish astronomer Ole R\u00f8mer used that idea in 1676 to explain why the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter appear to run alternately about 10 minutes ahead of or behind schedule over the course of a year. Christiaan Huygens then worked out a numerical estimate for the speed of light that was published in his Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e8re ( Treatise on Light , 1690). Bradley discovered that the fixed stars too suffer apparent annual changes in their positions. For example, a star near the pole of the ecliptic (seen at right angles to the plane of Earth\u2019s orbit) appears to execute a small circular motion, of 20 seconds of arc radius, in the course of a year. A second discovery by Bradley introduced an even more troublesome complication\u2014the nutation (or nodding) of Earth\u2019s axis, which has an amplitude of about 8 seconds. Because of aberration and nutation, the fullest possible precision of astronomical observations could not be achieved unless the observations were corrected for these effects.",
  "A major aspect of 19th-century astronomy was the move toward greater precision both in methods of calculation and in quantitative methods of observation. Here the natural successor to Bradley was Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel , who reduced Bradley\u2019s enormous collection of star positions for aberration and nutation and in 1818 published the results in a new star catalog of unprecedented accuracy, the Fundamenta Astronomiae (\u201cFoundations of Astronomy\u201d).",
  "No better demonstration of improved methods could be wished for than the near-simultaneous measurements of stellar parallaxes by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve of the star Vega in 1837, by Bessel of the star  61 Cygni in 1838, and by Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson of the triple star Alpha Centauri in 1838. The annual parallax is the tiny back-and-forth shift in the direction of a relatively nearby star, with respect to more-distant background stars, caused by the fact that Earth changes its vantage point over the course of a year. Since the acceptance of Copernicus \u2019s moving Earth, astronomers had known that stellar parallax must exist. But the effect is so small (because the diameter of Earth\u2019s orbit is tiny compared with the distance of even the nearest stars) that it had resisted all efforts at detection. For example, the parallax of 61 Cygni is 0.287 seconds of arc (1 second of arc = 1/3,600 of a degree). The shift from parallax was observed only after the development of precise astronomical instruments, such as the heliometer that German physicist and optician Joseph von Fraunhofer built for Bessel, that could measure stellar positions to the necessary accuracy of hundredths of a second of arc. (In the preceding century Bradley, who could measure stellar positions only with an accuracy of half a second of arc, had been making a failed attempt to detect stellar parallax when he stumbled instead on the aberration of light.) The successful measurement of stellar parallaxes gave for the first time accurate values for the distances of stars other than the Sun .",
  "  By about 1820 it was clear that Uranus was not keeping to the schedule of motion predicted for it. In the 1840s John Couch Adams in England and Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier in France independently sought to explain the anomaly through the gravitational attraction of an undiscovered planet outside the orbit of Uranus. Both Adams and Le Verrier assumed the rough validity of the Titius-Bode law to make their calculations easier. Adams predicted a place in the zodiac where astronomers should look, but at first he could not get the English astronomical community to tackle the job. Le Verrier had better luck, for his prediction was taken up immediately by Johann Gottfried Galle at the Berlin Observatory, who found the new planet Neptune in 1846, near the place in the sky where Le Verrier said it would be. This episode caused a stormy period in English-French scientific relations, as well as recriminations in the English astronomical community for the failure to pursue Adams\u2019s prediction in a timely way.",
  "  In Ireland a wealthy amateur, William Parsons, 3rd earl of Rosse , inspired by Herschel \u2019s example, continued the quest for larger and better telescopes . Because Herschel had treated the optics of his large telescopes as trade secrets, Rosse had to do all his own design by trial and error. In 1839 Rosse built a 36-inch (91-cm) reflecting telescope, with the mirror made of polished metal, and then, in 1845, the 72-inch (183-cm) \u201cLeviathan of Parsonstown.\u201d That year, using this gigantic instrument, Rosse observed and sketched the spiral form of the nebula known as Messier 51. Three years later he sketched the spiral shape of Messier 99. Rosse and his helpers eventually described more than 60 spiral nebulae.",
  "  In 1835 the French positivist philosopher Auguste Comte cited the chemical constitution of the stars as an example of knowledge that might be forever hidden. However, unknown to Comte, the development of spectroscopy was already revealing the composition of the stars and permitting the emergence of a true astrophysics. In 1802 English physician William Hyde Wollaston saw several dark gaps or lines in the Sun\u2019s spectrum and conjectured that these might be the natural boundaries between colours. The dark lines in the solar spectrum were rediscovered around 1814 in Munich by Fraunhofer , who cataloged some 500 of them. Fraunhofer noted that his dark D line in the yellow part of the solar spectrum matched up with the well-known bright line in the spectrum of a candle flame. Fraunhofer also showed that light from Venus shows the same structure as sunlight, and he observed dark lines in the spectra of a number of bright stars.",
  "A key step was taken in 1849 by French physicist Jean Foucault , who showed that the bright orange lines seen in the light emitted by a carbon arc could also be observed as dark absorption lines in sunlight that was passed through the gas around the arc . Thus, a gas that can be stimulated to emit a particular colour will also preferentially absorb that same colour. Around 1859 German chemist Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff showed how to associate spectral lines with particular chemical elements. From an analysis of the dark lines in the solar spectrum, Kirchhoff concluded that iron , calcium , magnesium , sodium , nickel , and chromium were present in the Sun. In 1868 English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer identified an orange line in a solar-prominence spectrum that had no counterpart in that of any known element, so he ascribed it to a new element, which he called helium (after helios , the Greek name for the Sun and the Sun god). Helium was not isolated on Earth until 1895 by Scottish chemist William Ramsay .",
  "In the 1860s Italian astrophysicist Angelo Secchi described the spectra of some 4,000 stars and classified them into four groups. A star\u2019s spectrum is continuous, with all the colours present, though it may be brighter in one or another part of the spectrum according to the temperature of the star. (Cooler stars are redder.) Typically, the continuous spectrum is also overlaid with a number of dark absorption lines. Secchi\u2019s classification scheme was based on the overall colour of the star, the number and kind of absorption lines, and other features of the spectrum. This work, performed before the application of photography to spectroscopy, was slow and very tedious.",
  "Also in the 1860s English astronomer William Huggins observed the spectrum of a bright nebula and found that it consisted only of bright emission lines. This was therefore a glowing gas \u2014a case of true nebulosity. Huggins went on to observe about 70 nebulae. He found that the nebulae consisted of two major groups. About one-third were gaseous, and about two-thirds showed the continuous spectrum that would be expected of unresolved stars.",
  "  A major centre of spectroscopy in the next generation was the Harvard College Observatory , under the direction of American astronomer Edward Charles Pickering . By putting a prism in front of the object lens of a telescope, his team was able to photograph the spectra of many stars at once. The resulting  Henry Draper Catalogue  (named to recognize the financial support for the project provided by Draper\u2019s widow) appeared in nine volumes between 1918 and 1924 and contained over 225,000 spectra. Key to this work was a new stellar-classification scheme (still in use today\u2014for example, the Sun is a G-type star) refined by American astronomer Annie Jump Cannon , who had joined Pickering\u2019s team in 1895.",
  " In the mid-19th century there was considerable dispute about the reality and nature of the Doppler effect . A shift in the frequency of light received from a moving source had been proposed in 1842 by the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler , who (wrongly) thought that in this way he could explain the colours of binary stars . The Doppler effect was demonstrated for sound by the Dutch physicist Christophorus Henricus Didericus Buys-Ballot in 1845 by putting musicians on a moving train. In 1868 Huggins measured a small shift in the position of the F line in the hydrogen spectrum for Sirius , which was interpreted as being caused by the radial motion of the star with respect to Earth . Strong confirmation of the Doppler effect for light was obtained in the 1870s by German astronomer Hermann Karl Vogel , who measured the spectral shift between the east and west edges of the rotating Sun. In the 1880s Vogel and German astronomer Julius Scheiner began to measure the radial velocities of stars by using photographic spectra. The tabulation of spectral types and radial velocities soon became a standard part of star cataloging.",
  "  The cataloging of stellar spectra opened the way for new discoveries, for it soon became clear that the spectral type of a star has a relation to the star\u2019s intrinsic brightness. However, since a star will look dimmer the farther away it is, the intrinsic brightness (or absolute magnitude ) of a star cannot be known unless one first has a way to determine the distance. American astronomer Henry Norris Russell in 1913 published a scatter plot correlating absolute magnitude with spectral type, using only stars for which he judged that the distances had been well determined. Slightly earlier, German astronomer Hans Rosenberg and Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung had plotted similar diagrams, using only stars from a single cluster , either the Pleiades or the Hyades . (Stars in a single cluster are all at roughly the same distance from Earth , so their apparent magnitudes can be used as replacements for their absolute magnitudes.) The resulting scatter plots are called Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagrams . The H-R diagram revealed that most stars lie on a \u201cmain sequence,\u201d in which absolute magnitude is positively correlated with temperature. Bluer main-sequence stars (spectral type O or B) are much brighter than main-sequence red stars (spectral type K or M). The H-R diagram also showed a second branch, in which there are reddish stars that are much brighter than those on the main sequence. If these bright red stars have the same surface temperature (because they are of the same spectral type) as a main-sequence star but are much brighter, they must be physically larger, and they soon came to be called \u201cred giants.\u201d White dwarfs were soon discovered as yet another branch. The H-R diagram became crucial for guiding speculations about the evolution of stars.",
  "The source of the energy that drives the stars had been a great mystery. In the 19th century, chemical combustion and heating due to gravitational contraction were the only possibilities, but Scottish physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) pointed out that a chemical process could hardly last more than 3,000 years. In various versions of heating by release of gravitational energy, the Sun was supposed to be contracting slowly (by about 75 metres [246 feet] per year) or else be heated by the continual infall of meteoric matter. After the discovery of radioactivity in the 1890s and the realization that Earth\u2019s interior was warmed by this mechanism, various schemes were proposed for explaining stellar energy in terms of radioactive decay. The true explanation came only after German American physicist Albert Einstein \u2019s 1905 publication of the mass-energy relation (  E = m  c  2  , a consequence of special relativity ). In the 1920s English astrophysicist Arthur Eddington proposed the proton-proton reaction , in which four atoms of hydrogen are combined to produce one atom of helium , with the mass difference released in the form of energy. Because of the primitive state of nuclear physics at the time, he could not say in detail how this might occur, but he pointed to the mere existence of helium in the stars as the surest proof that such a process must exist. Nuclear physics gained a firm foundation in the early 1930s with the discovery of the neutron and of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen with a proton and a neutron in its nucleus ). From then on, progress was rapid. In 1937 German physicist Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker discovered the CNO cycle , in which carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen act as catalysts in a sequence of nuclear reactions that leads to the conversion of hydrogen into helium. In 1939 German American physicist Hans Bethe published a more detailed and quantitative study of the CNO cycle that finally put stellar astrophysics on a secure footing. Bethe also treated in detail the proton-proton reaction that Eddington had only guessed at. In a collision at high temperature, two protons may stay close enough together for the brief time required for one of them to be converted into a neutron by emission of a positron; thus, deuterium is formed. From deuterium, helium may then be built up in several different ways. Bethe also showed that the CNO cycle is more important in high-temperature stars and the proton-proton reaction more important in cooler stars. Nuclear physics was successfully integrated with what was known about the conditions of temperature and density in the interiors of stars.",
  "  A key theoretical development for 20th-century astronomy and cosmology was the development of the theory of relativity , from 1905 to 1915, which eventually led to an explanation of the origin of the universe. The theory of relativity grew out of contradictions between electromagnetic theory (worked out by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s) and what people thought they knew about relativity of motion. As a high-school student, Albert Einstein formulated a clever thought experiment and reasoned to a contradiction. According to electromagnetic theory, a light wave consists of changing electric and magnetic fields . Einstein asked what one would see if one could run at the speed of light alongside a light wave. In the frame of reference of the runner, the light wave would be stationary. Hence its fields would not be changing, and consequently the light wave should not exist. Clearly, something was wrong.",
  "There were also experimental difficulties. At the close of the 19th century, it was widely believed that light needs a medium to propagate in (as do other wave disturbances, such as sound ). This all-pervading medium was given a name, the luminiferous (or light-carrying) ether . However, several experiments, including the famous Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887, failed to detect any motion of Earth with respect to the ether. Many physicists regarded this as a crisis, and some sought rather desperate ways out. Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald proposed in 1889 that a moving body, owing to its interaction with the ether, undergoes a contraction in the direction of its motion in just the right amount to explain the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. A similar idea was worked out in greater detail by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz .",
  " A B A B c  Einstein\u2019s approach was far more fundamental. In his 1905 paper \u201cZur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\u201d (\u201cOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\u201d), he proceeded axiomatically. He assumed, first, that all uniformly moving reference frames are equally valid for doing physics and, second, that the speed of light is always the same, regardless of the relative motion of the source and the receiver. The first postulate was unexceptional; it was a logical result of the scientific revolution from Copernicus to Galileo . The second postulate was unusual (and one can note how it resolves the paradox of the young Einstein: one simply cannot run alongside a light wave so that it appears stationary). From these two postulates, surprising consequences followed: time runs at different rates in different frames of reference; lengths are contracted in the direction of motion (not, as Lorentz and FitzGerald thought, owing to an interaction with the ether but rather owing to the very nature of space and time); and finally, the mass of a moving body increases without limit as the body\u2019s speed approaches that of light. All this is a part of the special theory of relativity (special because gravity is not included and only uniformly moving bodies are considered).",
  "Many of the same equations had been obtained earlier by Lorentz. In France too mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9 was tapping at the door. Relativity was in the air in 1905, and if Einstein had not written his paper, the same basic results would have been obtained. Einstein\u2019s merit was his clarity of thought and his axiomatic approach, which showed that something fundamental was at stake. The ether simply had no place in his worldview. Shortly afterward Einstein\u2019s former teacher mathematician Hermann Minkowski formulated the notion of space-time , in which time is regarded as a fourth dimension. This did not change the equations of relativity theory, but it greatly changed the way people thought about the theory and it helped prepare the way for the general theory.",
  "If the special theory of relativity was bound to happen, the same cannot be said of the general theory of relativity , which is a theory of the gravitational field. Einstein turned to the problem of gravitation shortly after publishing his special theory. By 1907 he had already become convinced that a gravitational field should deflect a ray of light. In developing his new theory, he was guided by two considerations. The first was the principle of equivalence\u2014that acceleration and gravitation are somehow manifestations of the same thing. For example, as Einstein put it, a freely falling man would not feel his own weight. The second consideration was general covariance\u2014namely, the assumption that the laws of physics should take the same mathematical forms in arbitrary frames of reference and not just in uniformly moving frames. The mathematics was difficult, and after years of groping, in 1915 Einstein found the general theory of relativity.",
  "Einstein had little to go on in the way of observational evidence\u2014only the anomalous advance of the perihelion of Mercury . If Mercury were the only planet orbiting the Sun , then, according to Newtonian physics, the orbit would be a perfect ellipse that would always preserve the same orientation. However, the other planets weakly attract Mercury and disturb its orbit so that the long axis of Mercury\u2019s orbital ellipse is not stationary but rotates around the Sun. The point of the orbit where Mercury is closest to the Sun is called the perihelion; thus, the perihelion slowly advances, in the same direction that Mercury moves.",
  "In 1859 Le Verrier announced that the perihelion of Mercury was advancing a little too quickly to be explained by the action of the known planets. The excess was tiny, about 38 seconds of arc per century, compared with the 527 seconds of arc per century that Le Verrier attributed to known planetary perturbations. Le Verrier had discovered Neptune by means of anomalies in the motion of Uranus . Therefore, he naturally guessed that the discrepancy in the motion of Mercury was due to an undiscovered ring of asteroids , or perhaps a planet, lying between Mercury and the Sun. The planet even acquired a name, Vulcan, but soon proved to be illusory. In 1895 American astronomer Simon Newcomb made a fresh study of the problem and confirmed the unexplained anomaly in the motion of the perihelion of Mercury, now in the amount of 43 seconds of arc per century.",
  "Before he published his new theory, Einstein checked that it gave the right answer for the Mercury problem. In the theory of general relativity, Newton\u2019s law of gravity , in which the gravitational force between two bodies decreases with the inverse square of the distance between them, is not completely accurate in describing massive bodies that are very near each other; rather, the law must be modified by a term that decreases with the inverse fourth power of the distance. The mass of the Sun is not very great, and no planets, aside from Mercury, move very near it; thus, in describing the solar system, Newton\u2019s law of gravity had been quite a successful approximation.",
  "  A second prediction of Einstein\u2019s gravity theory was a value for the bending of a ray of starlight as it passes by the Sun. Here Einstein had a bit of luck. In a preliminary version of the theory, the bending came out too small by half. Einstein had tried to get astronomers interested in detecting the bending by looking for apparent shifts in the locations of stars near the Sun during a total solar eclipse . However, for various reasons, including the intervention of World War I , no one had succeeded in making a test. Had astronomers been able to test this early prediction, they would have found it erroneous, which could well have impeded acceptance of the final (1915) version of the theory.",
  "  In England, Eddington was instrumental in spreading interest in Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. Eddington mastered the mathematics, wrote about the subject, and got his colleagues interested in testing the theory. Eddington and Sir Frank Dyson , the astronomer royal, persuaded the Royal Astronomical Society to mount two expeditions to observe the total solar eclipse of 1919, one to Brazil and the other, led by Eddington, to Principe Island, off the west coast of Africa. Stars near the Sun were photographed during totality, when the Sun\u2019s disk was covered by the Moon , and their positions were compared with earlier photographs made of the same part of the sky. The looked-for effect was small, but Eddington and Dyson confirmed that Einstein\u2019s prediction of the bending of light was correct. Their announcement caused an international sensation.",
  "The third effect of general relativity predicted by Einstein was the gravitational redshift. Light coming from a compact massive object should be slightly redshifted ; that is, the light should have a longer wavelength. Measuring this was a delicate business, as the expected shift was small and could easily be masked by other effects. Attempts to measure the gravitational redshift by using absorption lines in the solar spectrum led to contradictory and inconclusive results, but in 1925 American astronomer Walter Adams , at Mount Wilson Observatory , announced that he had determined the gravitational redshift of Sirius B, the white dwarf companion of Sirius . ( White dwarfs were expected to have much higher gravitational redshifts than stars like the Sun.) The confirmation of the gravitational redshift not only bolstered general relativity but also helped support Eddington\u2019s theory of stellar structure, which predicted enormous densities (and therefore very strong surface gravities) for white dwarfs. It was not realized until decades later that Adams\u2019s measurement of the gravitational redshift of Sirius B was too small by a factor of four. Compensating errors in Adams\u2019s measurements and in Eddington\u2019s ideas of the temperature and radius of Sirius B had produced a fortuitous agreement (Sirius B is even smaller than Eddington thought). This was another case of Einstein\u2019s being lucky, for a conflict between the measured redshift and the theoretical value could again have compromised the acceptance of general relativity. In the case of Adams\u2019s measurements, a major source of trouble was light from Sirius itself scattered into the Sirius B spectrum by Adams\u2019s instruments. However, by then the effect had been successfully measured in laboratories on Earth with just the value that Einstein\u2019s theory predicts.",
  "In Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity, a massive object produces a curvature of the space-time around it. Einstein made his own early predictions of observable phenomena by using partial and approximate solutions. Thus, Einstein was surprised when German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 found an exact solution for Einstein\u2019s field equations for the space-time around a spherical body. For the so-called exterior solution, the Schwarzschild space-time presents mild corrections to the Newtonian motion of bodies (such as that which explains the advance of the perihelion of Mercury). But lurking in Schwarzschild\u2019s solution (the so-called interior solution) are signs of a much stranger regime. If a body is so dense that it is confined to a region of radius less than 2 G  M / c  2 (where G is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light ), the solution becomes problematic: at this critical radius (called the Schwarzschild radius ), the solution seems to produce a singularity, where certain mathematical expressions become either zero or infinite. This aspect of Schwarzschild\u2019s solution caused enormous confusion for decades, and astrophysicists tried to paper over the problems by ignoring the interior part of the solution or by seeking coordinate systems in which the problems went away. But in 1939 American physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder published a study of what happens when a star has exhausted its stores of nuclear energy and begins to collapse. Basing their relativistic analysis on the Schwarzschild solution, Oppenheimer and Snyder showed that the Schwarzschild radius does not correspond to a singularity but defines a surface from which light cannot escape to infinity. With collapse, they wrote, the star closes itself off from any communication with an outside observer. This paper helped inaugurate the study of black holes , though these exotic objects did not really come into their own until the 1960s. (The term black hole was coined only in 1967, by American physicist John Archibald Wheeler .) The first plausible candidates for black holes were observed in the 1970s.",
  "Einstein almost immediately applied his gravity theory to the universe as a whole, publishing his first cosmological paper in 1917. Because he was not well acquainted with recent work in astronomy, he assumed that the universe was static and unchanging. Einstein assumed that matter was distributed uniformly throughout the universe, but he could not find a static solution to his field equations. The problem was that the mutual gravitation of all the matter in the universe would tend to make the universe contract. Therefore, Einstein introduced an additional term containing a factor \u039b, the \u201ccosmological constant.\u201d The new term provided a universal cosmic repulsive force, which could act at great distances to counteract the effects of gravity. When he later learned of the expansion of the universe, Einstein described the cosmological constant as the greatest blunder of his career. (But the cosmological constant has crept back into late 20th-century and 21st-century cosmology. Even when Einstein was wrong, he was often onto something profound.)",
  "Einstein\u2019s static solution represented a universe of finite volume but with no edges, as space curved back on itself. Thus, an imaginary traveler could travel forever in a straight line and never come to an edge of the universe. The space has positive curvature, so the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180\u00b0, though the excess would be apparent only in triangles of sufficient size. (A good two-dimensional analogy is Earth\u2019s surface. It is finite in area but has no edge.)",
  "  At the beginning of the 20th century, most professional astronomers still believed that the Milky Way was essentially the same thing as the visible universe. A minority believed in a theory of island universes\u2014that the spiral nebulae are enormous star systems, comparable to the Milky Way, and are scattered through space with vast empty distances between them. One objection to the island-universe theory was that very few spirals are seen near the plane of the Milky Way, the so-called Zone of Avoidance. Thus, the spirals must somehow be a part of the Milky Way system. But American astronomer Heber Curtis pointed out that some spirals that can be viewed edge-on obviously contain huge amounts of dust in their \u201cequatorial\u201d planes. One might also expect the Milky Way to have large amounts of dust throughout its plane, which would explain why many dim spirals cannot be seen there; visibility is simply obscured at low galactic latitudes. In 1917 Curtis also found three novae on his photographs of spirals; the faintness of these novae implied that the spirals were at great distances from the Milky Way.",
  " The static character of the universe was soon challenged. In 1912, at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, American astronomer Vesto M. Slipher had begun to measure the radial velocities of spiral nebulae. The first spiral that Slipher examined was the Andromeda Nebula , which turned out to be blueshifted\u2014that is, moving toward the Milky Way\u2014with a velocity of approach of 300 km (200 miles) per second, the greatest velocity ever measured for any celestial object up to that time. By 1917 Slipher had radial velocities for 25 spirals, some as high as 1,000 km (600 miles) per second. Objects moving at such speeds could hardly belong to the Milky Way. Although a few were blueshifted, the overwhelming majority were redshifted , corresponding to motion away from the Milky Way. Astronomers did not, however, immediately conclude that the universe is expanding. Rather, because Slipher\u2019s spirals were not uniformly distributed around the sky, astronomers used the data to try to deduce the velocity of the Sun with respect to the system of spirals. The majority of Slipher\u2019s spirals were on one side of the Milky Way and receding, whereas a few were on the other side and approaching. For Slipher, the Milky Way was itself a spiral, moving with respect to a greater field of spirals.",
  "In 1917 Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter found another apparently static cosmological solution of the field equations, different from Einstein\u2019s, that showed a correlation between distance and redshift. Although it was not clear that de Sitter\u2019s solution could describe the universe, as it was devoid of matter, this did motivate astronomers to look for a relationship between distance and redshift. In 1924 Swedish astronomer Karl Lundmark published an empirical study that gave a roughly linear relation (though with lots of scatter) between the distances and velocities of the spirals. The difficulty was in knowing the distances accurately enough. Lundmark used novae that had been observed in the Andromeda Nebula to establish the distance of that nebula by assuming that these novae would have the same average absolute brightness as novae in the Milky Way whose distances were approximately known. For more-distant spirals, Lundmark invoked the crude assumptions that those spirals had to have the same diameter and brightness as the Andromeda Nebula. Thus, the novae functioned as standard candles (that is, objects with a defined brightness), and for more-distant spirals, the spirals themselves became the standard candle.",
  "On the theoretical side, between 1922 and 1924 Russian mathematician Aleksandr Friedmann studied nonstatic cosmological solutions to Einstein\u2019s equations. These went beyond Einstein\u2019s model by allowing expansion or contraction of the universe and beyond de Sitter\u2019s model by allowing the universe to contain matter. Friedmann also introduced cosmological models with negative curvature. (In a negatively curved space, the angles of a triangle add up to less than 180\u00b0.) Friedmann\u2019s solutions had little immediate impact, partly because of his early death in 1925 and partly because he had not connected his theoretical work with astronomical observations. It did not help that Einstein published a note claiming that Friedmann\u2019s 1922 paper contained a fundamental error; Einstein later withdrew this criticism.",
  "In 1927 Belgian physicist and cleric Georges Lema\u00eetre published a paper that put the theoretical and empirical squarely together under the title \u201cUn Univers homog\u00e8ne de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des n\u00e9buleuses extra-galactiques\u201d (\u201cA Homogeneous Universe of Constant Mass and Growing Radius, Accounting for the Radial Velocity of the Extragalactic Nebulae\u201d). Lema\u00eetre began with a study of the dynamical solutions of Einstein\u2019s model (with the cosmological constant included)\u2014that is, those solutions with a cosmic radius that varies with time. He treated the Doppler shifts of the spiral nebulae as evidence of a cosmic expansion and used the redshifts and distances of 42 nebulae to deduce a value for the slope of the velocity-distance graph. At the time, Lema\u00eetre\u2019s paper had little impact, partly because it had been published in the rather obscure Annales de la Societe Scientifique de Bruxelles (\u201cAnnals of the Scientific Society of Brussels\u201d), and it was fully appreciated only a few years later, when cosmologists and astronomers had become more open to the idea of an expanding universe.",
  "In 1929, building on Friedmann\u2019s work, American mathematician and physicist Howard P. Robertson summarized the most general space-time metric that is possible under the assumption that the universe is homogeneous (of the same density everywhere) and isotropic (the same in all spatial directions). (A metric is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem that describes the inherent geometry of space-time.) Similar results were obtained by English mathematician Arthur G. Walker, so this metric is called the Robertson-Walker metric. The Robertson-Walker metric and the expansion of the universe (as revealed by the galactic redshifts) were the twin foundations on which much of 20th-century cosmology was constructed.",
  "American astronomer Edwin Hubble was the most influential observer of his generation. Using the 100-inch (254-cm) reflector at the Mount Wilson Observatory , in 1923 Hubble identified a Cepheid variable star in the Andromeda Nebula. From this he was able to determine a more-precise distance to the nebula, using the Cepheid variable as a much better standard candle. The Cepheids vary in brightness in a regular and easily identifiable way, with a quick increase in brightness followed by a slower decline. In 1908 American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt had found a relationship between the period and the brightness: the brighter the Cepheid, the longer its period. Ejnar Hertzsprung and American astronomer Harlow Shapley went on to calibrate the relationship in terms of absolute magnitudes . Hubble could easily measure the Cepheid\u2019s period. He could then use the calibration curve to determine the star\u2019s absolute magnitude, or intrinsic brightness, and the intrinsic brightness compared with the observed brightness gave the distance of the star. This measurement established beyond question that the Andromeda Nebula is outside the Milky Way and is a galaxy in its own right. Further work by Hubble with Cepheid variables in other spiral nebulae confirmed the island-universe theory.",
  "When Hubble turned to the problem of the distance-redshift relationship, he soon superseded Slipher\u2019s work. In 1929 Hubble published a paper showing a clear linear relationship between distance and redshift, which he interpreted as a velocity. He used Slipher\u2019s velocities but added more that had been measured at Mount Wilson by American astronomer Milton Humason. Distances of the nearer nebulae were found by using Cepheids as standard candles. At greater distances Hubble used as a standard candle the brightest individual stars that could be resolved (assuming that these would be of the same brightness in all galaxies ), and at greater distances yet, the luminosities of the nebulae themselves were the standard candle. Hubble\u2019s paper led to a rapid acceptance of the distance-redshift (or distance-velocity) relation in the astronomical community, and this relationship is known as \u201cHubble\u2019s law,\u201d although, as discussed above, it had been several times anticipated.",
  "Hubble himself was quite cautious about what the distance-velocity relationship implied about the history of the universe, but the natural conclusion to draw was that in the remote past all the galaxies had been close together. The distance-velocity relationship being linear, if galaxy B was 10 times farther away than galaxy A, it would be receding at 10 times the speed. By the same token, if the galactic clock was run backward to the beginning, both A and B would be at the same point (galaxy B retracing the greater distance at greater speed). Hubble\u2019s value for the slope of the line in the velocity-versus-distance graph (today known as the Hubble constant ) was 500 km (300 miles) per second per million parsecs (megaparsec). (A parsec is about 3.26 light-years and is the distance at which the radius of Earth\u2019s orbit would subtend an angle of one second.) With this value for the Hubble constant, the universe appeared to be about two billion years old.",
  "Subsequent studies indicated that this estimate was far too young. The study of radioactive isotopes in rocks suggested that Earth had to be 4.5 billion years old, which would make the universe younger than some of the objects in it. The value of the Hubble constant has been revised repeatedly. A major correction was made in 1952 when American astronomer Walter Baade discovered that Hubble had seriously underestimated galactic distances, because there are actually two different kinds of Cepheids. Baade\u2019s recalibration resulted in a halving of the Hubble constant. A further major correction by American astronomer Allan Sandage in 1958 brought it down to about 100 km (60 miles) per second per megaparsec. Sandage, who was Hubble\u2019s former observing assistant, showed that what Hubble had taken as the brightest individual stars in a galaxy were actually tight clusters of bright stars embedded in gaseous nebulae . For several decades the value of the constant was (according to different researchers) in the range 50\u2013100 km (80\u2013160 miles) per second per megaparsec. The currently accepted value for Hubble\u2019s constant is around 71 km (44 miles) per second per megaparsec, with a margin of error of about 5 percent. The associated age of the universe, tightly constrained by many types of observations, is about 13.7 billion years.",
  "Several astronomers proposed mechanisms to explain the redshifts without accepting the expansion of the universe. In 1929 the Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky proposed that photons gradually give up their energy to the intergalactic matter through which they travel, through a process analogous to Compton scattering , leading to a progressive reddening of the light. Others simply suggested various versions of the reddening of light with distance (collectively these were called the \u201ctired light\u201d hypothesis) without attempting to provide a physical explanation. These proposals never commanded a wide following, and during the 1930s astronomers and cosmologists increasingly embraced the expansion of the universe.",
  "The general-relativistic cosmological models and the observed expansion of the universe suggest that the universe was once very small. In the 1930s astronomers began to explore evolutionary models of the universe, a good example being Georges Lema\u00eetre\u2019s primeval atom. According to Lema\u00eetre, the universe began as a single atom having an atomic weight equal to the entire mass of the universe, which then decayed by a super-radiative process until atoms of ordinary atomic weight emerged.",
  "A pioneering study of elemental abundances in the stars had been made by British-born American astronomer Cecilia Payne in her doctoral thesis of 1925. The amount of each element present in a star can be inferred from the strengths of the absorption lines in the star\u2019s spectrum, if these are controlled for the temperature and pressure of the star. One fact that emerged early on was that stars did not have the same composition as Earth and were predominantly hydrogen and helium . In 1938 Norwegian mineralogist Victor Goldschmidt published a detailed summary of data on cosmic abundances of the elements, running over most of the periodic table.",
  "Although it is possible to see Lema\u00eetre\u2019s theory as a progenitor of the \u201c big bang \u201d theory, it was a paper of 1948 by American physicist Ralph Alpher and his dissertation supervisor, George Gamow , that changed the direction of research by putting nuclear physics into cosmology. As a joke, Gamow added the name of physicist Hans Bethe in order to preserve the Alpher-Bethe-Gamow sequence of (almost) Greek letters. In the a\u00df\u03b3 paper, which was only one page long, Alpher and Gamow maintained that the formation of the elements ( nucleosynthesis ) began about 20 seconds after the start of the expansion of the universe. They supposed that the universe began with a hot dense gas of neutrons , which started to decay into protons and electrons . The building up of the elements was due to successive neutron capture (and readjustments of charge by \u00df-decay ). Using recently published values for the neutron-capture cross-sections of the elements, they integrated their equations to produce a graph of the abundances of all the elements, which resulted in a smooth-curve approximation to the jagged abundance curve that had been published by Goldschmidt.",
  "In another paper in 1948, Alpher and American physicist Robert Herman argued that electromagnetic radiation from the early universe should still exist, but with the expansion it should now correspond to a temperature of about 5 K (kelvins, or \u2212268 \u00b0C [\u2212451 \u00b0F]) and thus would be visible to radio telescopes. In a 1953 paper, Alpher, Herman, and American physicist James Follin provided a stage-by-stage history of the early universe, concluding that nucleosynthesis was essentially complete after 30 minutes of cosmic expansion. They deduced that if all the neutrons available at the end of nucleosynthesis went into making helium only, the present-day hydrogen-to-helium ratio would be between 7:1 and 10:1 in terms of numbers of atoms. This would correspond to a present-day universe that was between 29 and 36 percent helium by weight. (Because some neutrons would go into building other elements, the helium figures would be upper limits.) They pointed out that these figures were of the same order as the hydrogen-to-helium ratios measured in planetary nebulae and stellar atmospheres, though these showed quite a large range.",
  "The Gamow-Alpher theory largely ceased development after 1953, and it failed to attract a following, in spite of the fact that they had published in highly prominent journals and had made detailed, testable predictions. Unfortunately, it was not until the 1960s that the hydrogen-to-helium ratio became known precisely enough to test the theory. More crucially, Alpher and Gamow failed to interest radio astronomers in looking for the 5-K background radiation, and their prediction was soon forgotten.",
  " London Daily Express  In England, also in 1948, an alternative theory emerged called the steady-state universe. Different versions of it were proposed by English mathematician and astronomer Fred Hoyle and by the team of British mathematician and cosmologist Hermann Bondi and British astronomer Thomas Gold, but the key idea was that although the universe was expanding, its average properties did not change with time. As the universe expanded, the density of matter would be expected to diminish, but new hydrogen atoms were created that formed clouds of gas that condensed into new stars and galaxies. The number of new hydrogen atoms required per year was so tiny that one could not hope to observe this process directly. However, there were predictable observational consequences that should allow one to distinguish between a steady-state universe or a big-bang universe. (The term big bang was coined by Hoyle as a mildly pejorative characterization of the rival theory in a radio talk in 1949.)",
  "For example, in a big-bang universe, when one looks at galaxies that are far away, one also sees them as they were in the remote past (because of the travel time of the light). Thus, one might expect that distant galaxies are less-evolved or that they contain more young stars. But in a steady-state universe, one would see galaxies at all possible stages of evolutionary development at even the farthest distances. The density of galaxies in space should also diminish with time in a big-bang universe. Therefore, galaxies at great distances should be more densely crowded together than nearby galaxies are. But in a steady-state universe, the average density of galaxies should be about the same everywhere and at every time. In the 1950s the Cambridge radio astronomer Martin Ryle showed that there were more radio galaxies at great distances than there were nearby, thus showing that the universe had evolved over time, a result that could not be explained in steady-state theory.",
  "The discovery of quasars (quasi-stellar radio sources) in the early 1960s also told heavily against the steady-state theory. Quasars were first identified as strong radio sources that in visible light appear to be identified with small starlike objects. Further, they have large redshifts , which implies that they are very far away. From their distance and their apparent luminosity, it was inferred that they emit copious amounts of energy; a single quasar might be brighter than a whole galaxy. There was no room for such objects in a steady-state universe, in which the contents of any region of space (seen as it is now or as it was long ago) should be roughly similar. The quasars were a clear sign that the universe was evolving.",
  "Steady-state theory never had a large following, and its supporters were centred in Britain. Nevertheless, having a competing theory forced the big-bang cosmologists to strengthen their arguments and to collect supporting data. A key question centred on the abundances and origins of the chemical elements . In steady-state theory, it was essential that all the elements could be synthesized in stars. By contrast, in the a\u00df\u03b3 paper, Alpher and Gamow tried to show that all the elements could be made in the big bang. Of course, in a more reasonable view, big-bang theorists had to accept that some element formation does take place in stars, but they were keen to show that the stars could not account for all of it. In particular, the stars could not be the source of most of the light elements. For example, it was impossible to see how during the lifetime of a galaxy the stars could build up the helium content to 30 percent.",
  "One obstacle for big-bang theory was the absence of any stable isotopes at atomic mass 5 or 8. In 1952 Austrian-born American astrophysicist Edwin Salpeter proposed that three alpha particles (helium nuclei) can come together to produce carbon-12 and that this happens often enough to resolve the mass-gap problem in the interiors of stars. However, conditions in the early universe were not right for bridging the mass gap in this way, so the mass-gap problem was seen as favouring steady-state theory. Hoyle adopted Salpeter\u2019s proposal in 1953. In 1957 Hoyle, with American astronomers William Fowler , Margaret Burbidge , and Geoffrey Burbidge (or B 2 FH, as their paper was later called), gave an impressive and detailed account of the abundances of most elements in terms of conditions appropriate to stellar interiors. Although the B 2 FH paper was not explicitly a steady-state theory, it was often seen as favouring that model, as it had not made use of temperature and pressure conditions appropriate to the big bang. But in papers of 1964 (with English astrophysicist Roger Tayler) and 1967 (with Fowler and American physicist Robert Wagoner), Hoyle concluded that the lighter elements could be built up satisfactorily only in conditions like those of the big bang. Hoyle himself continued to favour supermassive objects as the origin of the elements over the big bang, but most astronomers saw this work as vindicating big-bang theory. In defending a failed cosmological theory, Hoyle had done an enormous amount of good work of lasting value on nucleosynthesis.",
  "When good estimates of the cosmic abundance of deuterium and other light elements became available, big-bang theory proved capable of detailed explanation of the cosmic abundances of all the light elements. In current scenarios, hydrogen (H) and its heavier isotope, deuterium ( 2 H), most of the two helium isotopes ( 3 He and 4 He), and lithium ( 7 Li) were produced shortly after the big bang. Given whatever one assumes about the present-day density of matter in the universe, one can calculate what sort of cosmic abundances should have resulted from the big bang. It is regarded as a triumph of the big-bang model that the present-day abundances of these elements can all be explained from one set of initial conditions. According to current thinking, most of the heavier elements were then built up in stars, neutron star mergers, and supernova explosions.",
  "In 1965 American astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert W. Wilson were working at Bell Laboratories on a 6-metre (20-foot) horn antenna. The original purpose of the antenna was to detect reflected signals from high-altitude balloons , with the goal of applying the technology to communications satellites , but Penzias and Wilson had adapted it for doing radio astronomy. They detected a constant, persistent signal, corresponding to an excess temperature of 3.3 K (\u2212269.9 \u00b0C [\u2212453.7 \u00b0F]). After eliminating every source of circuit noise they could think of, and even shooing a pair of pigeons that had been roosting (and leaving behind \u201cwhite dielectric material\u201d) in the horn, they found that the signal remained and that it was constant, no matter in which direction the telescope was pointed. At nearby Princeton University , they consulted with American physicist Robert Dicke, who was studying oscillatory models of the universe with hot phases and who was therefore not surprised by what they had found. About the same time, astrophysicist James Peebles, Dicke\u2019s former student, also published a paper predicting the existence of a universal background radiation at a temperature of 10 K (\u2212263 \u00b0C [\u2212441 \u00b0F]), apparently completely unaware of Alpher and Herman\u2019s earlier prediction. Suddenly the pieces fell together. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) was accepted as the third major piece of evidence in support of the big-bang theory. In the early stages of the expansion, when atoms were all still completely ionized, the universe was opaque to electromagnetic radiation . But when the universe cooled enough to allow the formation of neutral atoms , it suddenly became transparent to electromagnetic radiation (just as light can travel through air). At this \u201cdecoupling time,\u201d the electromagnetic radiation was of very high energy and very short wavelengths. With the continued expansion of space, wavelengths were stretched until they reached their current microwave lengths (from about a millimetre to tens of centimetres in wavelength). Thus, every bit of empty space acts as a source of radio waves\u2014a phenomenon predicted (twice!) by big-bang theory but for which steady-state theory had no ready explanation. For most cosmologists, this marked the end of the steady-state theory, even though Hoyle and his collaborators continued to tweak and adjust the theory to try to meet objections.",
  "By the mid-1960s, big-bang theory had become the standard cosmology, underpinned by the observed expansion, the measured abundances of the light elements, and the presence of the cosmic microwave background. Of course, the theory was eventually to acquire many different forms and refinements.",
  "Over the course of the 20th century, it became clear that there is much more to the universe than meets the eye. On the basis of early estimates of the mass density of the Milky Way , English physicist and mathematician James Jeans suggested in 1922 that the galaxy might contain three times as many dark stars as visible ones. In 1933 Fritz Zwicky, by studying the dynamics of clusters of galaxies , concluded that there is not enough visible matter in the galaxies to hold the clusters together gravitationally. He also pointed out that the measured quantity of luminous matter was far below the value that would be necessary for critical density\u2014i.e., to produce a universe with an expansion that would gradually slow to a halt at infinity\u2014but he speculated that the dark matter could conceivably be enough to make up the difference.",
  "Jeans\u2019s and Zwicky\u2019s comments did not attract a lot of attention, and dark matter became a central issue only in the 1970s. In 1974 Peebles, Jeremiah Ostriker, and Amos Yahil in the United States and Jaan Einasto, Ants Kaasik, and Enn Saar in Soviet Estonia concluded, on the basis of studies of galactic dynamics, that 90\u201395 percent of the universe must be in the form of dark matter. American astronomer Vera Rubin published a paper in 1978 studying the rotational velocities of stars in galaxies as a function of their distances from the galactic centre. Rotational velocities were found to be nearly constant over a fairly large radial distance, though predictions based on the distribution of visible matter implied that they would decrease with distance. Rubin\u2019s discoveries were interpreted as evidence for the presence of substantial amounts of dark matter in the haloes around galaxies. About the same time, radio astronomers , using a spectral line of hydrogen at 21-cm wavelength , obtained a similar result in the outer parts of galaxies where there is little starlight. Present-day thinking is that the universe is very close to flat ( Euclidean ) in its geometry, which implies that it is close to critical density. However, the nucleosynthesis calculations show agreement with the present-day abundances of the light elements only if one supposes that ordinary baryonic matter (i.e., matter made of protons and neutrons ) accounts for no more than about 5 percent of the critical density.",
  "Candidates for dark matter in the form of ordinary baryonic matter include black holes , Jupiter -sized planets , and brown dwarfs (starlike objects that are too small to ignite nuclear reactions in their interiors). Some of the new grand unified theories (GUTs) of particle physics predict the existence of large quantities of exotic fundamental particles, called weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The 1998 discovery that neutrinos have mass (they had been considered perfectly massless since Austrian-born physicist Wolfgang Pauli \u2019s prediction of them in 1930) provides a small part of the answer. But the nature of the bulk of dark matter is still unknown.",
  "  By placing astronomical instruments in space, they would be free from the interference of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Observing instruments in space have played important roles since the age of artificial satellites began with Sputnik in 1957. Astronomical instruments had earlier been sent aloft on balloons and rockets , but satellites permitted vastly longer observing times and greater stability. The very first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1 , launched in 1958 as a project designed for the International Geophysical Year, was involved in a major discovery. The radiation detector on board gave the first signs of the belts of energetic charged particles that surround Earth (the Van Allen belts , named for American physicist James Van Allen ). Beginning in 1962, a series of eight Orbital Solar Observatories monitored the Sun for more than a complete sunspot cycle and had far clearer views of the Sun\u2019s corona than could be obtained from Earth-based observatories, because of the distortion of optical images by Earth\u2019s atmosphere .",
  "  The first successful planetary flyby was that of Venus in 1962 by Mariner 2 , which carried several instruments but no cameras. The first flyby to return images was the Mariner 4 mission in 1965, which sent back 22 images of Mars . The first flybys of Jupiter and Saturn \u2014 Pioneer 10 (1973) and Pioneer 11 (1979)\u2014sent back spectacular images of the planets and their rings and satellites that fundamentally altered planetary science and captured the public imagination. Specialized satellites have extended astronomical observing into the infrared , gamma-ray , and X-ray portions of the spectrum.",
  " In 1989 the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite began precise measurements of the microwave background radiation . This gave, by 1994, a perfect fit to a blackbody spectrum corresponding to 2.726K (\u2212270.424 \u00b0C [\u2212454.763 \u00b0F]). However, the most significant result, announced by American physicist George Smoot in 1992, was COBE\u2019s detection of small fluctuations in the temperature in different directions in space\u2014variations as small as a few parts in 100,000\u2014that correspond to density fluctuations in the early universe at the decoupling time, about 300,000 years after the big bang. This discovery came as a relief to cosmologists, because the earlier failure to detect fluctuations in the spectrum was starting to cause difficulties for theories of structure formation in the early universe.",
  " By far the most ambitious instrument put into Earth orbit was the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), launched in 1990. Shortly afterward it was discovered that a design flaw in the principal mirror greatly reduced the image quality, but this was fixed by compensating optical devices inserted on a subsequent service trip by astronauts to the telescope. Among the original missions of the HST were determining more accurate values of the Hubble constant and the deceleration parameter, with the goal of limiting the number of possible cosmological models. The deceleration parameter is a measure of the rate at which the expansion of the universe is slowing down as the universe expands against gravity .",
  "In the 1980s astronomers began to use Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. These are believed to come about in the following way. A white dwarf star in a binary orbit with a neighbour can slowly pull material off, gradually increasing its own mass. Ordinarily the mass of the white dwarf could not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.4 solar masses, or it would collapse to form a neutron star . However, in the case of white dwarfs rich in carbon , with the slow accretion of material pulled from the neighbour, the core temperature rises until the nuclear ignition of carbon causes a runaway explosion. Because of the slow accretion and the mass limit, these supernovae are remarkably uniform in their brightness; moreover, because they are so bright, they can be seen at great distances. In short, the uniform and extreme brightness of Type Ia supernovae make them excellent standard candles.",
  "  In the 1990s two groups used observations of Type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies to work out distances to those galaxies, and thus how the rate of the universe\u2019s expansion changed over time, more precisely than ever before. The Supernova Cosmology Project, led by American physicist Saul Perlmutter , and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, directed by Australian astronomer Brian Schmidt and American astronomer Adam Riess , used observations taken with ground-based telescopes as well as with the HST. The result was most unexpected. Far from finding a better value for the deceleration parameter, after a period of confusion and contradiction, both groups found that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up. The direct observations were that distant supernovae appeared to be 20\u201325 percent dimmer than expected. The two teams ruled out such possibilities as dimming by dust, and their papers, published in 1998 and 1999, led to the same general conclusion. The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and that acceleration began only about five billion or six billion years ago.",
  "  The consensus emerging from the Ia supernovae projects was that the geometry of the universe is essentially flat, and therefore quite close to the critical density, with matter making up only about 30 percent of the total energy density and \u201c dark energy \u201d making up the remaining 70 percent. (Subsequent research has slightly modified these figures.) Although other possibilities are open, the dark energy is often identified with an Einsteinian cosmological constant that provides a universal repulsive force, which explains the acceleration. The nature of the dark energy is unknown. It may be connected with quantum-mechanical vacuum energy; however, there are serious unresolved difficulties with this possibility. Of the roughly 30 percent of the universe that is matter, only about 5 percent can be ordinary baryonic matter. Of this, only a small part is visible in the form of planets, stars, and galaxies.",
