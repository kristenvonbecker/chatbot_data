  " mood , also called mode , in grammar, a category that reflects the speaker\u2019s view of the ontological character of an event. This character may be, for example, real or unreal, certain or possible, wished or demanded. Mood is often marked by special verb forms, or inflections, but it is sometimes expressed by a single word or a phrase.",
  "Languages frequently distinguish grammatically three moods: the indicative, the imperative, and the subjunctive. The indicative is generally used for factual or neutral situations, as in English \u201cJohn did his work\u201d and Spanish \u201cJuan hizo su trabajo.\u201d The imperative conveys commands or requests\u2014for example, \u201cDo your work.\u201d It is distinguished by the absence of an explicit subject, the implied subject being \u201cyou.\u201d The Spanish imperative, which also possesses an implied subject, assumes a distinct verbal form, as in \u201cHaga su trabajo.\u201d The functions of the subjunctive mood vary widely across languages. Some notions often expressed by the subjunctive are doubt, possibility, necessity, desire, and future time. The English subjunctive is fairly limited in its use. Usually, it is found only in formal styles, such as the sentence \u201cIt is necessary that he be ready on time.\u201d More often, subjunctive meanings are expressed by modal auxiliary verbs, such as can , must , or may , as in \u201cHe must be ready on time.\u201d",
  "Other moods sometimes grammaticalized in languages include conditional, hortative (urging), dubitative (doubting), optative (wishing), hypothetical, and potential."
