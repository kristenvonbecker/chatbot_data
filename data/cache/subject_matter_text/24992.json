  " community , also called biological community , in biology , an interacting group of various species in a common location. For example, a forest of trees and undergrowth plants , inhabited by animals and rooted in soil containing bacteria and fungi , constitutes a biological community.",
  "A brief treatment of biological communities follows. For full treatment, see  Biosphere .",
  "Among the factors that determine the overall structure of a community are the number of species ( diversity ) within it, the number of each species (abundance) found within it, the interactions among the species, and the ability of the community to return to normal after a disruptive influence such as fire or drought . The change of biological communities over time is known as succession, or ecological succession .",
  "  The various species in a community each occupy their own ecological niche. The niche of a species includes all of its interactions with other members of the community, including competition , predation , parasitism , and mutualism . The organisms within a community can be positioned along food chains by showing which eats which, and these positions are known as trophic levels. The first level includes the producers\u2014the photosynthetic plants\u2014which convert the Sun\u2019s radiant energy into nutrients available to other organisms in the community. These plants are eaten by herbivores (plant-eaters, or primary consumers), the second trophic level. Herbivores are, in turn, eaten by carnivores (flesh-eaters), which are frequently eaten by larger carnivores (secondary and tertiary consumers, respectively). The food chain ends when the last link dies and is attacked by various bacteria and fungi, the decomposers that break down dead organic matter and thereby release essential nutrients back into the environment.",
  "An ecosystem consists of the biological community of an area together with its physical environment."
