  " Private Lives , in full Private Lives: An Intimate Comedy , comedy in three acts by No\u00ebl Coward , published and produced in 1930. This cynical comment on love and marriage is one of Coward\u2019s most brilliantly realized plays and is characterized by his trademark witty dialogue. Elyot Chase and his second wife, Sibyl, are honeymooning on the French Riviera when he discovers that his first wife, Amanda Prynne, and her second husband, Victor, have the room next to theirs. Elyot and Amanda\u2019s attraction to each other is too strong to ignore; they run off to Paris together only to discover that their love is based on a mutual craving for violent arguments and physical brawls."
