  " information retrieval , recovery of information, especially in a database stored in a computer . Two main approaches are matching words in the query against the database index (keyword searching) and traversing the database using hypertext or hypermedia links. Evolving information-retrieval techniques, exemplified by developments with Internet  search engines , combine natural language, hyperlinks, and keyword searching. Internet retrieval can be complicated by the location of the content, whether it is accessible on the common \"surface web\" or only on the deep web or dark web . Other techniques that seek higher levels of retrieval precision are studied by researchers involved with artificial intelligence ."
