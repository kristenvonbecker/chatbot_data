  "The Provisional State of Deseret, a precursor of the state of Utah, established the University of Deseret in 1850. Classes began the same year, but, because of insufficient funding, instruction was suspended from 1853 to 1867. In 1869 the university was reorganized under the leadership of John R. Park, who added science, education, and classical studies to the curriculum; engineering courses began in 1891. In 1892 the school was renamed the University of Utah and in 1900 relocated to a new campus. The College of Mines and Earth Sciences opened in 1901 and the School of Medicine in 1905.
