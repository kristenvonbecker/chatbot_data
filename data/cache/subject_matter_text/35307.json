  " \u02bfAj\u0101\u02beib al-makhl\u016bq\u0101t  The Freer collection includes 19th-century American paintings and has the world\u2019s largest collection of James McNeill Whistler \u2019s works, including the famed Peacock Room, decorated by Whistler as a prank. It was originally the dining room of an English shipbuilder, who after purchasing Whistler\u2019s painting \u201cRose and Silver: The Princess from the Land of Porcelain,\u201d permitted the artist to redecorate the room to harmonize with the picture. Using the peacock as his theme, Whistler trimmed borders off Oriental rugs and painted over leather wallcovering to create an exotic gold and turquoise atmosphere for his painting. Two gold peacocks with crystal eyes adorn the wall opposite the picture. The entire room was purchased by Freer for $63,000.",
