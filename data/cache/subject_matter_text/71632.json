  "  temperature , measure of hotness or coldness expressed in terms of any of several arbitrary scales and indicating the direction in which heat  energy will spontaneously flow\u2014i.e., from a hotter body (one at a higher temperature) to a colder body (one at a lower temperature). Temperature is not the equivalent of the energy of a thermodynamic system ; e.g., a burning match is at a much higher temperature than an iceberg , but the total heat energy contained in an iceberg is much greater than the energy contained in a match. Temperature, similar to pressure or density , is called an intensive property\u2014one that is independent of the quantity of matter being considered\u2014as distinguished from extensive properties, such as mass or volume.",
  "  Three temperature scales are in general use today. The Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) temperature scale is used in the United States and a few other English-speaking countries. The Celsius (\u00b0C) temperature scale is standard in virtually all countries that have adopted the metric system of measurement, and it is widely used in the sciences. The Kelvin (K) scale , an absolute temperature scale (obtained by shifting the Celsius scale by \u2212273.15\u00b0 so that absolute zero coincides with 0 K), is recognized as the international standard for scientific temperature measurement.",
  "In certain fields of engineering, another absolute temperature scale, the Rankine scale ( see  William Rankine ), is preferred over the Kelvin scale. Its unit of measure\u2014the degree Rankine (\u00b0R)\u2014equals the Fahrenheit degree, as the kelvin equals one Celsius degree.",
  "The R\u00e9aumur (\u00b0Re) temperature scale (or octogesimal division) was widely used in parts of Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries; it later was used primarily to measure the temperature of mixtures during brewing, of syrups in the production of certain food products, and of milk during cheese making."
