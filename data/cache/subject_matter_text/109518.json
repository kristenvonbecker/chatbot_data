  " sculpture , an artistic form in which hard or plastic materials are worked into three-dimensional art objects. The designs may be embodied in freestanding objects, in reliefs on surfaces, or in environments ranging from tableaux to contexts that envelop the spectator. An enormous variety of media may be used, including clay, wax, stone, metal, fabric, glass, wood, plaster, rubber, and random \u201cfound\u201d objects. Materials may be carved, modeled, molded, cast, wrought, welded, sewn, assembled, or otherwise shaped and combined.",
  " Sculpture is not a fixed term that applies to a permanently circumscribed category of objects or sets of activities. It is, rather, the name of an art that grows and changes and is continually extending the range of its activities and evolving new kinds of objects. The scope of the term was much wider in the second half of the 20th century than it had been only two or three decades before, and in the fluid state of the visual arts in the 21st century nobody can predict what its future extensions are likely to be.",
  "Certain features which in previous centuries were considered essential to the art of sculpture are not present in a great deal of modern sculpture and can no longer form part of its definition. One of the most important of these is representation. Before the 20th century, sculpture was considered a representational art, one that imitated forms in life, most often human figures but also inanimate objects, such as game, utensils, and books. Since the turn of the 20th century, however, sculpture has also included nonrepresentational forms. It has long been accepted that the forms of such functional three-dimensional objects as furniture, pots, and buildings may be expressive and beautiful without being in any way representational; but it was only in the 20th century that nonfunctional, nonrepresentational, three-dimensional works of art began to be produced.",
  "Before the 20th century, sculpture was considered primarily an art of solid form, or mass. It is true that the negative elements of sculpture\u2014the voids and hollows within and between its solid forms\u2014have always been to some extent an integral part of its design, but their role was a secondary one. In a great deal of modern sculpture, however, the focus of attention has shifted, and the spatial aspects have become dominant. Spatial sculpture is now a generally accepted branch of the art of sculpture.",
  "It was also taken for granted in the sculpture of the past that its components were of a constant shape and size and, with the exception of items such as Augustus Saint-Gaudens\u2019s Diana (a monumental weather vane), did not move. With the recent development of kinetic sculpture, neither the immobility nor immutability of its form can any longer be considered essential to the art of sculpture.",
  "Finally, sculpture since the 20th century has not been confined to the two traditional forming processes of carving and modeling or to such traditional natural materials as stone, metal, wood, ivory, bone, and clay. Because present-day sculptors use any materials and methods of manufacture that will serve their purposes, the art of sculpture can no longer be identified with any special materials or techniques.",
  "Through all these changes, there is probably only one thing that has remained constant in the art of sculpture, and it is this that emerges as the central and abiding concern of sculptors: the art of sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that is especially concerned with the creation of form in three dimensions.",
  "Sculpture may be either in the round or in relief. A sculpture in the round is a separate, detached object in its own right, leading the same kind of independent existence in space as a human body or a chair. A relief does not have this kind of independence. It projects from and is attached to or is an integral part of something else that serves either as a background against which it is set or a matrix from which it emerges.",
  "The actual three-dimensionality of sculpture in the round limits its scope in certain respects in comparison with the scope of painting. Sculpture cannot conjure the illusion of space by purely optical means or invest its forms with atmosphere and light as painting can. It does have a kind of reality, a vivid physical presence that is denied to the pictorial arts. The forms of sculpture are tangible as well as visible, and they can appeal strongly and directly to both tactile and visual sensibilities. Even the visually impaired, including those who are congenitally blind, can produce and appreciate certain kinds of sculpture. It was, in fact, argued by the 20th-century art critic Sir Herbert Read that sculpture should be regarded as primarily an art of touch and that the roots of sculptural sensibility can be traced to the pleasure one experiences in fondling things.",
  "All three-dimensional forms are perceived as having an expressive character as well as purely geometric properties. They strike the observer as delicate, aggressive, flowing, taut, relaxed, dynamic, soft, and so on. By exploiting the expressive qualities of form, a sculptor is able to create images in which subject matter and expressiveness of form are mutually reinforcing. Such images go beyond the mere presentation of fact and communicate a wide range of subtle and powerful feelings.",
  "The aesthetic raw material of sculpture is, so to speak, the whole realm of expressive three-dimensional form. A sculpture may draw upon what already exists in the endless variety of natural and man-made form, or it may be an art of pure invention. It has been used to express a vast range of human emotions and feelings from the most tender and delicate to the most violent and ecstatic.",
  "All human beings, intimately involved from birth with the world of three-dimensional form, learn something of its structural and expressive properties and develop emotional responses to them. This combination of understanding and sensitive response, often called a sense of form, can be cultivated and refined. It is to this sense of form that the art of sculpture primarily appeals.",
  "This article deals with the elements and principles of design; the materials, methods, techniques, and forms of sculpture; and its subject matter, imagery, symbolism, and uses. For the history of sculpture in antiquity, see art and architecture, Anatolian ; art and architecture, Egyptian ; art and architecture, Iranian ; and art and architecture, Mesopotamian . For the development of sculpture in various regions, see such articles as sculpture, Western ; and African art . For related art forms, see mask and pottery .",
  "The two most important elements of sculpture\u2014mass and space\u2014are, of course, separable only in thought. All sculpture is made of a material substance that has mass and exists in three-dimensional space. The mass of sculpture is thus the solid, material, space-occupying bulk that is contained within its surfaces. Space enters into the design of sculpture in three main ways: the material components of the sculpture extend into or move through space; they may enclose or enfold space, thus creating hollows and voids within the sculpture; and they may relate one to another across space. Volume, surface, light and shade, and colour are supporting elements of sculpture.",
  " Torso of a Young Girl Torso of a Young Girl  The amount of importance attached to either mass or space in the design of sculpture varies considerably. In Egyptian sculpture and in most of the sculpture of the 20th-century artist Constantin Brancusi, for example, mass is paramount, and most of the sculptor\u2019s thought was devoted to shaping a lump of solid material. In 20th-century works by Antoine Pevsner or Naum Gabo, on the other hand, mass is reduced to a minimum, consisting only of transparent sheets of plastic or thin metal rods. The solid form of the components themselves is of little importance; their main function is to create movement through space and to enclose space. In works by such 20th-century sculptors as Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, the elements of space and mass are treated as more or less equal partners.",
  "It is not possible to see the whole of a fully three-dimensional form at once. The observer can only see the whole of it if he turns it around or goes around it himself. For this reason it is sometimes mistakenly assumed that sculpture must be designed primarily to present a series of satisfactory projective views and that this multiplicity of views constitutes the main difference between sculpture and the pictorial arts, which present only one view of their subject. Such an attitude toward sculpture ignores the fact that it is possible to apprehend solid forms as volumes, to conceive an idea of them in the round from any one aspect. A great deal of sculpture is designed to be apprehended primarily as volume.",
  "A single volume is the fundamental unit of three-dimensional solid form that can be conceived in the round. Some sculptures consist of only one volume, others are configurations of a number of volumes. The human figure is often treated by sculptors as a configuration of volumes, each of which corresponds to a major part of the body, such as the head, neck, thorax, and thigh.",
  " The Family of Man The Family of Man  Holes and cavities in sculpture, which are as carefully shaped as the solid forms and are of equal importance to the overall design, are sometimes referred to as negative volumes.",
  "The surfaces of sculpture are in fact all that one actually sees. It is from their inflections that one makes inferences about the internal structure of the sculpture. A surface has, so to speak, two aspects: it contains and defines the internal structure of the masses of the sculpture, and it is the part of the sculpture that enters into relations with external space.",
  "The expressive character of different kinds of surfaces is of the utmost importance in sculpture. Double-curved convex surfaces suggest fullness, containment, enclosure, the outward pressure of internal forces. In the aesthetics of Indian sculpture such surfaces have a special metaphysical significance. Representing the encroachment of space into the mass of the sculpture, concave surfaces suggest the action of external forces and are often indicative of collapse or erosion. Flat surfaces tend to convey a feeling of material hardness and rigidity; they are unbending or unyielding, unaffected by either internal or external pressures. Surfaces that are convex in one curvature and concave in the other can suggest the operation of internal pressures and at the same time a receptivity to the influence of external forces. They are associated with growth, with expansion into space.",
  "Unlike the painter, who creates light effects within the work, the sculptor manipulates actual light on the work. The distribution of light and shade over the forms of his or her work depends upon the direction and intensity of light from external sources. Nevertheless, to some extent he or she can determine the kinds of effect this external light will have. If the artist knows where the work is to be sited, he or she can adapt it to the kind of light it is likely to receive. The brilliant overhead sunlight of Egypt and India demands a different treatment from the dim interior light of a northern medieval cathedral. Then again, it is possible to create effects of light and shade, or chiaroscuro, by cutting or modeling deep, shadow-catching hollows and prominent, highlighted ridges. Many late Gothic sculptors used light and shade as a powerful expressive feature of their work, aiming at a mysterious obscurity, with forms broken by shadow emerging from a dark background. Greek, Indian, and most Italian Renaissance sculptors shaped the forms of their work to receive light in a way that makes the whole work radiantly clear.",
  "The colouring of sculpture may be either natural or applied. In the recent past, sculptors became more aware than ever before of the inherent beauty of sculptural materials. Under the slogan of \u201ctruth to materials\u201d many of them worked their materials in ways that exploited their natural properties, including colour and texture. More recently, however, there has been a growing tendency to use bright artificial colouring as an important element in the design of sculpture.",
  "In the ancient world and during the Middle Ages almost all sculpture was artificially coloured, usually in a bold and decorative rather than a naturalistic manner. The sculptured portal of a cathedral, for example, would be coloured and gilded with all the brilliance of a contemporary illuminated manuscript. Combinations of differently coloured materials, such as the ivory and gold of some Greek sculpture, were not unknown before the 17th century; but the early Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini greatly extended the practice by combining variously coloured marbles with white marble and gilt bronze.",
  "It is doubtful whether any principles of design are universal in the art of sculpture, for the principles that govern the organization of the elements of sculpture into expressive compositions differ from style to style. In fact, distinctions made among the major styles of sculpture are largely based on a recognition of differences in the principles of design that underlie them. Thus, the art historian Erwin Panofsky was attempting to define a difference of principle in the design of Romanesque and Gothic sculpture when he stated that the forms of Romanesque were conceived as projections from a plane outside themselves, while those of Gothic were conceived as being centred on an axis within themselves. The \u201cprinciple of axiality\u201d was considered by Panofsky to be \u201cthe essential principle of classical statuary,\u201d which Gothic had rediscovered.",
  "The principles of sculptural design govern the approaches of sculptors to such fundamental matters as orientation, proportion, scale, articulation, and balance.",
  "For conceiving and describing the orientation of the forms of sculpture in relation to each other, to a spectator, and to their surroundings, some kind of spatial scheme of reference is required. This is provided by a system of axes and planes of reference.",
  "An axis is an imaginary centre line through a symmetrical or near symmetrical volume or group of volumes that suggests the gravitational pivot of the mass. Thus, all the main components of the human body have axes of their own, while an upright figure has a single vertical axis running through its entire length. Volumes may rotate or tilt on their axes.",
  "Planes of reference are imaginary planes to which the movements, positions, and directions of volumes, axes, and surfaces may be referred. The principal planes of reference are the frontal, the horizontal, and the two profile planes.",
  " David David  The principles that govern the characteristic poses and spatial compositions of upright figures in different styles of sculpture are formulated with reference to axes and the four cardinal planes: for example, the principle of axiality already referred to; the principle of frontality, which governs the design of Archaic sculpture; the characteristic contrapposto (pose in which parts of the body, such as upper and lower, tilt or even twist in opposite directions) of Michelangelo\u2019s figures; and in standing Greek sculpture of the Classical period the frequently used balanced \u201cchiastic\u201d pose (stance in which the body weight is taken principally on one leg, thereby creating a contrast of tension and relaxation between the opposite sides of a figure).",
  "Proportional relations exist among linear dimensions, areas, and volumes and masses. All three types of proportion coexist and interact in sculpture, contributing to its expressiveness and beauty. Attitudes toward proportion differ considerably among sculptors. Some sculptors, both abstract and figurative, use mathematical systems of proportion; for example, the refinement and idealization of natural human proportions was a major preoccupation of Greek sculptors. Indian sculptors employed iconometric canons, or systems of carefully related proportions, that determined the proportions of all significant dimensions of the human figure. African and other sculptors base the proportions of their figures on the subjective importance of the parts of the body. Unnatural proportions may be used for expressive purposes or to accommodate a sculpture to its surroundings. The elongation of the figures on the Portail Royal (\u201cRoyal Portal\u201d) of Chartres cathedral does both: it enhances their otherworldliness and also integrates them with the columnar architecture.",
  "Sometimes it is necessary to adapt the proportions of sculpture to suit its position in relation to a viewer. A figure sited high on a building, for example, is usually made larger in its upper parts in order to counteract the effects of foreshortening. This should be allowed for when a sculpture intended for such a position is exhibited on eye level in a museum.",
  "The scale of sculpture must sometimes be considered in relation to the scale of its surroundings. When it is one element in a larger complex, such as the facade of a building, it must be in scale with the rest. Another important consideration that sculptors must take into account when designing outdoor sculpture is the tendency of sculpture in the open air\u2014particularly when viewed against the sky\u2014to appear less massive than it does in a studio. Because one tends to relate the scale of sculpture to one\u2019s own human physical dimensions, the emotional impact of a colossal figure and a small figurine are quite different.",
  "In ancient and medieval sculpture the relative scale of the figures in a composition is often determined by their importance; e.g., enslaved persons are much smaller than kings or nobles. This is sometimes known as hierarchic scale.",
  "The joining of one form to another may be accomplished in a variety of ways. In much of the work of the 19th-century French sculptor Auguste Rodin, there are no clear boundaries, and one form is merged with another in an impressionistic manner to create a continuously flowing surface. In works by the Greek sculptor Praxiteles, the forms are softly and subtly blended by means of smooth, blurred transitions. The volumes of Indian sculpture and the surface anatomy of male figures in the style of the Greek sculptor Polyclitus are sharply defined and clearly articulated. One of the main distinctions between the work of Italian and northern Renaissance sculptors lies in the Italians\u2019 preference for compositions made up of clearly articulated, distinct units of form and the tendency of the northern Europeans to subordinate the individual parts to the allover flow of the composition.",
  " Hermes Carrying the Infant Dionysus Hermes Carrying the Infant Dionysus bce  The balance, or equilibrium, of freestanding sculpture has three aspects. First, the sculpture must have actual physical stability. This can be achieved by natural balance\u2014that is, by making the sculpture stable enough in itself to stand firmly\u2014which is easy enough to do with a four-legged animal or a reclining figure but not with a standing figure or a tall, thin sculpture, which must be secured to a base. The second aspect of balance is compositional. The interaction of forces and the distribution of weight within a composition may produce a state of either dynamic or static equilibrium. The third aspect of balance applies only to sculpture that represents a living figure. A live human figure balances on two feet by making constant movements and muscular adjustments. Such an effect can be conveyed in sculpture by subtle displacements of form and suggestions of tension and relaxation.",
  "Sculpture has long been closely related to architecture through its role as architectural decoration and also at the level of design. Architecture, like sculpture, is concerned with three-dimensional form; and, although the central problem in the design of buildings is the organization of space rather than mass, there are styles of architecture that are effective largely through the quality and organization of their solid forms. Ancient styles of stone architecture, particularly Egyptian, Greek, and Mexican, tend to treat their components in a sculptural manner. Moreover, most buildings viewed from the outside are compositions of masses. The growth of spatial sculpture is so intimately related to the opening up and lightening of architecture, which the development of modern building technology has made possible, that many 20th-century sculptors can be said to have treated their work in an architectural manner.",
  " The Ecstasy of St. Teresa The Ecstasy of St. Teresa  Some forms of relief sculpture approach very closely the pictorial arts of painting, drawing, engraving, and so on. And sculptures in the round that make use of chiaroscuro and that are conceived primarily as pictorial views rather than as compositions in the round are said to be \u201cpainterly\u201d; for example, Bernini\u2019s Ecstasy of St. Teresa .",
  "The borderlines between sculpture and pottery and the metalworking arts are not clear-cut, and many pottery and metal artifacts have every claim to be considered as sculpture. Today there is a growing affinity between the work of industrial designers and sculptors. Sculptural modeling techniques, and sometimes sculptors themselves, are often involved, for example, in the initial stages of the design of new automobile bodies.",
  "The close relationships that exist between sculpture and the other visual arts are attested by the number of artists who have readily turned from one art to another; for example, Michelangelo, Bernini, Pisanello, Degas, and Picasso.",
  "Any material that can be shaped in three dimensions can be used sculpturally. Certain materials, by virtue of their structural and aesthetic properties and their availability, have proved especially suitable. The most important of these are stone, wood, metal, clay, ivory, and plaster. There are also a number of materials that have only recently come into use.",
  "Throughout history, stone has been the principal material of monumental sculpture. There are practical reasons for this: many types of stone are highly resistant to the weather and therefore suitable for external use; stone is available in all parts of the world and can be obtained in large blocks; many stones have a fairly homogeneous texture and a uniform hardness that make them suitable for carving; stone has been the chief material used for the monumental architecture with which so much sculpture has been associated.",
  "Stones belonging to all three main categories of rock formation have been used in sculpture. Igneous rocks, which are formed by the cooling of molten masses of mineral as they approach the Earth\u2019s surface, include granite, diorite, basalt, and obsidian. These are some of the hardest stones used for sculpture. Sedimentary rocks, which include sandstones and limestones, are formed from accumulated deposits of mineral and organic substances. Sandstones are agglomerations of particles of eroded stone held together by a cementing substance. Limestones are formed chiefly from the calcareous remains of organisms. Alabaster (gypsum), also a sedimentary rock, is a chemical deposit. Many varieties of sandstone and limestone, which vary greatly in quality and suitability for carving, are used for sculpture. Because of their method of formation, many sedimentary rocks have pronounced strata and are rich in fossils.",
  " bce  Metamorphic rocks result from changes brought about in the structure of sedimentary and igneous rocks by extreme pressure or heat. The most well-known metamorphic rocks used in sculpture are the marbles, which are recrystallized limestones. Italian Carrara marble, the best known, was used by Roman and Renaissance sculptors, especially Michelangelo, and is still widely used. The best-known varieties used by Greek sculptors, with whom marble was more popular than any other stone, are Pentelic\u2014from which the Parthenon and its sculpture are made\u2014and Parian.",
  "Because stone is extremely heavy and lacks tensile strength, it is easily fractured if carved too thinly and not properly supported. A massive treatment without vulnerable projections, as in Egyptian and pre-Columbian American Indian sculpture, is therefore usually preferred. Some stones, however, can be treated more freely and openly; marble in particular has been treated by some European sculptors with almost the same freedom as bronze, but such displays of virtuosity are achieved by overcoming rather than submitting to the properties of the material itself.",
  "The colours and textures of stone are among its most delightful properties. Some stones are fine-grained and can be carved with delicate detail and finished with a high polish; others are coarse-grained and demand a broader treatment. Pure white Carrara marble, which has a translucent quality, seems to glow and responds to light in a delicate, subtle manner. (These properties of marble were brilliantly exploited by 15th-century Italian sculptors such as Donatello and Desiderio da Settignano.) The colouring of granite is not uniform but has a salt-and-pepper quality and may glint with mica and quartz crystals. It may be predominantly black or white or a variety of grays, pinks, and reds. Sandstones vary in texture and are often warmly coloured in a range of buffs, pinks, and reds. Limestones vary greatly in colour, and the presence of fossils may add to the interest of their surfaces. A number of stones are richly variegated in colour by the irregular veining that runs through them.",
  " bce ce    Hardstones, or semiprecious stones, constitute a special group, which includes some of the most beautiful of all substances. The working of these stones, along with the working of more precious gemstones, is usually considered as part of the glyptic (gem carving or engraving), or lapidary, arts, but many artifacts produced from them can be considered small-scale sculpture. They are often harder to work than steel. First among the hardstones used for sculpture is jade, which was venerated by the ancient Chinese, who worked it, together with other hardstones, with extreme skill. It was also used sculpturally by Maya and Mexican artists. Other important hardstones are rock crystal, rose quartz, amethyst, agate, and jasper.",
  "The principal material of sculpture in Africa, Oceania, and North America, wood has also been used by every great civilization; it was used extensively during the Middle Ages, for example, especially in Germany and central Europe. Among modern sculptors who have used wood for important works are Ernst Barlach , Ossip Zadkine , and Henry Moore.",
  "Both hardwoods and softwoods are used for sculpture. Some are close-grained, and they cut like cheese; others are open-grained and stringy. The fibrous structure of wood gives it considerable tensile strength, so that it may be carved thinly and with greater freedom than stone. For large or complex open compositions, a number of pieces of wood may be jointed. Wood is used mainly for indoor sculpture, for it is not as tough or durable as stone; changes of humidity and temperature may cause it to split, and it is subject to attack by insects and fungus. The grain of wood is one of its most attractive features, giving variety of pattern and texture to its surfaces. Its colours, too, are subtle and varied. In general, wood has a warmth that stone does not have, but it lacks the massive dignity and weight of stone.",
  "  The principal woods for sculpture are oak, mahogany, limewood, walnut, elm, pine, cedar, boxwood, pear, and ebony; but many others are also used. The sizes of wood available are limited by the sizes of trees; North American Indians, for example, could carve gigantic totem poles in pine, but boxwood is available only in small pieces.",
  "In the 20th century, wood was used by many sculptors as a medium for construction as well as for carving. Laminated timbers, chipboards, and timber in block and plank form can be glued, jointed, screwed, or bolted together, and given a variety of finishes.",
  "Wherever metal technologies have been developed, metals have been used for sculpture. The amount of metal sculpture that has survived from the ancient world does not properly reflect the extent to which it was used, for vast quantities have been plundered and melted down. Countless ancient metal sculptures have been lost in this way, as has almost all the goldwork of pre-Columbian American Indians.",
  "The metal most used for sculpture is bronze, which is basically an alloy of copper and tin; but gold, silver, aluminum, copper, brass, lead, and iron have also been widely used. Most metals are extremely strong, hard, and durable, with a tensile strength that permits a much greater freedom of design than is possible in either stone or wood. A life-size bronze figure that is firmly attached to a base needs no support other than its own feet and may even be poised on one foot. Considerable attenuation of form is also possible without risk of fracture.",
  "The colour, brilliant lustre, and reflectivity of metal surfaces have been highly valued and made full use of in sculpture although, since the Renaissance, artificial patinas have generally been preferred as finishes for bronze.",
  "Metals can be worked in a variety of ways in order to produce sculpture. They can be cast\u2014that is, melted and poured into molds; squeezed under pressure into dies, as in coin making; or worked directly\u2014for example, by hammering, bending, cutting, welding, and repouss\u00e9 (hammered or pressed in relief).",
  "Important traditions of bronze sculpture are Greek, Roman, Indian (especially Chola), African (Bini and Yoruba), Italian Renaissance, and Chinese. Gold was used to great effect for small-scale works in pre-Columbian America and medieval Europe. A fairly recent discovery, aluminum has been used a great deal by modern sculptors. Iron has not been used much as a casting material, but in recent years it has become a popular material for direct working by techniques similar to those of the blacksmith. Sheet metal is one of the principal materials used nowadays for constructional sculpture. Stainless steel in sheet form has been used effectively by the American sculptor David Smith.",
  "Clay is one of the most common and easily obtainable of all materials. Used for modeling animal and human figures long before men discovered how to fire pots, it has been one of the sculptor\u2019s chief materials ever since.",
  "Clay has four properties that account for its widespread use: when moist, it is one of the most plastic of all substances, easily modeled and capable of registering the most detailed impressions; when partially dried out to a leather-hard state or completely dried, it can be carved and scraped; when mixed with enough water, it becomes a creamy liquid known as slip, which may be poured into molds and allowed to dry; when fired to temperatures of between 700 and 1,400 \u00b0C (1,300 and 2,600 \u00b0F), it undergoes irreversible structural changes that make it permanently hard and extremely durable.",
  "Sculptors use clay as a material for working out ideas; for preliminary models that are subsequently cast in such materials as plaster, metal, and concrete or carved in stone; and for pottery sculpture.",
  "Depending on the nature of the clay body itself and the temperature at which it is fired, a finished pottery product is said to be earthenware, which is opaque, relatively soft, and porous; stoneware, which is hard, nonporous, and more or less vitrified; or porcelain, which is fine-textured, vitrified, and translucent. All three types of pottery are used for sculpture. Sculpture made in low-fired clays, particularly buff and red clays, is known as terra-cotta (baked earth). This term is used inconsistently, however, and is often extended to cover all forms of pottery sculpture.",
  "Unglazed clay bodies can be smooth or coarse in texture and may be coloured white, gray, buff, brown, pink, or red. Pottery sculpture can be decorated with any of the techniques invented by potters and coated with a variety of beautiful glazes.",
  "  Paleolithic sculptors produced relief and in-the-round work in unfired clay. The ancient Chinese, particularly during the Tang (618\u2013907 ce ) and Song (960\u20131279 ce ) dynasties, made superb pottery sculpture, including large-scale human figures. The best-known Greek works are the intimate small-scale figures and groups from Tanagra . Mexican and Maya sculptor-potters produced vigorous, directly modeled figures. During the Renaissance, pottery was used in Italy for major sculptural projects, including the large-scale glazed and coloured sculptures of Luca della Robbia and his family, which are among the finest works in the medium. One of the most popular uses of the pottery medium has been for the manufacture of figurines\u2014at Staffordshire, Meissen, and S\u00e8vres, for example.",
  "The main source of ivory is elephant tusks; but walrus, hippopotamus, narwhal (an Arctic aquatic animal), and, in Paleolithic times, mammoth tusks also were used for sculpture. Ivory is dense, hard, and difficult to work. Its colour is creamy white, which usually yellows with age; and it will take a high polish. A tusk may be sawed into panels for relief carving or into blocks for carving in the round; or the shape of the tusk itself may be used. The physical properties of the material invite the most delicate, detailed carving, and displays of virtuosity are common.",
  " Queen Mother Pendant Mask: Iyoba Queen Mother Pendant Mask: Iyoba  Ivory was used extensively in antiquity in the Middle and Far East and the Mediterranean. An almost unbroken Christian tradition of ivory carving reaches from Rome and Byzantium to the end of the Middle Ages. Throughout this time, ivory was used mainly in relief, often in conjunction with precious metals, enamels, and precious stones to produce the most splendid effects. Some of its main sculptural uses were for devotional diptychs, portable altars, book covers, retables (raised shelves above altars), caskets, and crucifixes. The Baroque period, too, is rich in ivories, especially in Germany. A fine tradition of ivory carving also existed in Benin, a former kingdom of West Africa.",
  "Related to ivory, horn and bone have been used since Paleolithic times for small-scale sculpture. Caribou horn and walrus tusks were two of the Inupiaq and Inuit carver\u2019s most important materials. One of the finest of all medieval \u201civories\u201d is a carving in whalebone, The Adoration of the Magi .",
  "Plaster of paris (sulfate of lime) is especially useful for the production of molds, casts, and preliminary models. It was used by Egyptian and Greek sculptors as a casting medium and is today the most versatile material in the sculptor\u2019s workshop.",
  "When mixed with water, plaster will in a short time recrystallize, or set\u2014that is, become hard and inert\u2014and its volume will increase slightly. When set, it is relatively fragile and lacking in character and is therefore of limited use for finished work. Plaster can be poured as a liquid, modeled directly when of a suitable consistency, or easily carved after it has set. Other materials can be added to it to slacken its setting, to increase its hardness or resistance to heat, to change its colour, or to reinforce it.",
  "The main sculptural use of plaster in the past was for molding and casting clay models as a stage in the production of cast metal sculpture. Many sculptors today omit the clay-modeling stage and model directly in plaster. As a mold material in the casting of concrete and fibreglass sculpture, plaster is widely used. It has great value as a material for reproducing existing sculpture; many museums, for example, use such casts for study purposes.",
  "  Basically, concrete is a mixture of an aggregate (usually sand and small pieces of stone) bound together by cement. A variety of stones, such as crushed marble, granite chips, and gravel, can be used, each giving a different effect of colour and texture. Commercial cement is gray, white, or black; but it can be coloured by additives. The cement most widely used by sculptors is ciment fondu , which is extremely hard and quick setting. A recent invention\u2014at least, in appropriate forms for sculpture\u2014concrete is rapidly replacing stone for certain types of work. Because it is cheap, hard, tough, and durable, it is particularly suitable for large outdoor projects, especially decorative wall surfaces. With proper reinforcement it permits great freedom of design. And by using techniques similar to those of the building industry, sculptors are able to create works in concrete on a gigantic scale.",
  "When synthetic resins, especially polyesters, are reinforced with laminations of glass fibre, the result is a lightweight shell that is extremely strong, hard, and durable. It is usually known simply as fibreglass. After having been successfully used for car bodies, boat hulls, and the like, it has developed recently into an important material for sculpture. Because the material is visually unattractive in itself, it is usually coloured by means of fillers and pigments. It was first used in sculpture in conjunction with powdered metal fillers in order to produce cheap \u201ccold-cast\u201d substitutes for bronze and aluminum, but with the recent tendency to use bright colours in sculpture it is now often coloured either by pigmenting the material itself or by painting. It is possible to model fibreglass, but more usually it is cast as a laminated shell.",
  "Various formulas for modeling wax have been used in the past, but these have been generally replaced by synthetic waxes. The main uses of wax in sculpture have been as a preliminary modeling material for metal casting by the lost-wax , or cire-perdue, process (see Methods and techniques , below) and for making sketches. It is not durable enough for use as a material in its own right, although it has been used for small works, such as wax fruit, that can be kept under a glass dome.",
  "Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 (pulped paper bonded with glue) has been used for sculpture, especially in the Far East. Mainly used for applied arts, especially masks, it can have considerable strength; the Japanese, for example, made armour from it. Sculpture made of sheet paper is a limited art form used only for ephemeral and usually trivial work.",
  "Numerous other permanent materials\u2014such as shells, amber, and brick\u2014and ephemeral ones\u2014such as feathers, baker\u2019s dough, sugar, bird seed, foliage, ice and snow, and cake icing\u2014have been used for fashioning three-dimensional images. In view of late 20th-century trends in sculpture it is no longer possible to speak of \u201cthe materials of sculpture.\u201d Modern sculpture has no special materials. Any material, natural or man-made, is likely to be used, including inflated polyethylene, foam rubber, expanded polystyrene, fabrics, and neon tubes; the materials for a sculpture by Claes Oldenburg, for example, are listed as canvas, cloth, Dacron, metal, foam rubber, and Plexiglas. Real objects, too, may be incorporated in sculpture, as in the mixed-medium compositions of Edward Kienholz; even junk has its devotees, who fashion \u201cjunk\u201d sculpture. Food was also used, as in the brightly coloured wrapped candy of Felix Gonzalez-Torres \u2019s \u201cUntitled\u201d (Portrait of Ross in L.A.) (1991), the sugar of Kara Walker \u2019s A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby (2014), and a banana in Maurizio Cattelan \u2019s conceptual piece Comedian (2019).",
  "Although a sculptor may specialize in, say, stone carving or direct metalwork, the art of sculpture is not identifiable with any particular craft or set of crafts. It presses into its service whatever crafts suit its purposes. Technologies developed for more utilitarian purposes are often easily adapted for sculpture; in fact, useful artifacts and sculptured images have often been produced in the same workshop, sometimes by the same craftsman. The methods and techniques employed in producing a pot, a bronze harness trapping, a decorative stone molding or column, a carved wooden newel post, or even a fibreglass car body are essentially the same as those used in sculpture. For example, the techniques of repouss\u00e9 , metal casting, blacksmithing, sheet-metal work, and welding, which are used for the production of functional artifacts and decorative metalwork, are also used in metal sculpture; and the preparation, forming, glazing, decoration, and firing of clay are basically the same in both utilitarian pottery and pottery sculpture. The new techniques used by sculptors in the 20th century were closely related to the new techniques applied in building and industrial manufacture.",
  "The conception of an artifact or a work of art\u2014its form, imaginative content, and expressiveness\u2014is the concern of a designer, and it should be distinguished from the execution of the work in a particular technique and material, which is the task of a craftsman. A sculptor often functions as both designer and craftsman, but these two aspects of sculpture may be separated.",
  "Certain types of sculpture depend considerably for their aesthetic effect on the way in which their material has been directly manipulated by the artist. The direct, expressive handling of clay in a model by Rodin, or the use of the chisel in the stiacciato (very low) reliefs of the 15th-century Florentine sculptor Donatello could no more have been delegated to a craftsman than could the brushwork of Rembrandt . The actual physical process of working materials is for many sculptors an integral part of the art of sculpture, and their response to the working qualities of the material\u2014such as its plasticity, hardness, and texture\u2014is evident in the finished work. Design and craftsmanship are intimately fused in such a work, which is a highly personal expression.",
  "Even when the direct handling of material is not as vital as this to the expressiveness of the work, it still may be impossible to separate the roles of the artist as designer and craftsman. The qualities and interrelationships of forms may be so subtle and complex that they cannot be adequately specified and communicated to a craftsman. Moreover, many aspects of the design may actually be contributed during the process of working. Michelangelo\u2019s way of working, for example, enabled him to change his mind about important aspects of composition as the work proceeded.",
  "A complete fusion of design and craftsmanship may not be possible if a project is a large one or if the sculptor is unable to do all of the work him- or herself. The sheer physical labour of making a large sculpture can be considerable, and sculptors from Phidias in the 5th century bce to Henry Moore in the 20th century, for example, have employed pupils and assistants to help with it. Usually the sculptor delegates the time-consuming first stages of the work or some of its less important parts to his or her assistants and executes the final stages or the most important parts him- or herself.",
  "On occasion, a sculptor may function like an architect or industrial designer. He or she may do no direct work at all on the finished sculpture, his or her contribution being to supply exhaustive specifications in the form of drawings and perhaps scale models for a work that is to be entirely fabricated by craftsmen. Obviously, such a procedure excludes the possibility of direct, personal expression through the handling of the materials; thus, works of this kind usually have the same anonymous, impersonal quality as architecture and industrial design. An impersonal approach to sculpture was favoured by many sculptors of the 1960s such as William Tucker, Donald Judd , and William Turnbull. They used the skilled anonymous workmanship of industrial fabrications to make their large-scale, extremely precise, simple sculptural forms that are called \u201cprimary structures.\u201d",
  "Broadly speaking, the stages in the production of a major work of sculpture conform to the following pattern: the commission; the preparation, submission, and acceptance of the design; the selection and preparation of materials; the forming of materials; surface finishing; installation or presentation.",
  "Almost all of the sculpture of the past and some present-day sculpture originates in a demand made upon the sculptor from outside, usually in the form of a direct commission or through a competition. If the commission is for a portrait or a private sculpture, the client may only require to see examples of the artist\u2019s previous work; but if it is a public commission, the sculptor is usually expected to submit drawings and maquettes (small-scale, three-dimensional sketch models) that give an idea of the nature of the finished work and its relation to the site. He or she may be free to choose his or her own subject matter or theme, or it may be more or less strictly prescribed. A medieval master sculptor, for example, received the program for a complex scheme of church sculpture from theological advisers, and Renaissance contracts for sculpture were often extremely specified and detailed. Today a great deal of sculpture is not commissioned. It arises out of the sculptor\u2019s private concern with form and imagery, and he or she works primarily to satisfy him- or herself. When the work is finished he or she may exhibit and attempt to sell it in an art gallery.",
  "Most of the materials used by 20th-century sculptors were readily available in a usable form from builders\u2019 or sculptors\u2019 suppliers, but certain kinds of sculpture may involve a good deal of preparatory work on the materials. A sculptor may visit a stone quarry in order to select the material for a large project and to have it cut into blocks of the right size and shape. And since stone is costly to transport and best carved when freshly quarried, he or she may decide to do all of his or her work at the quarry. Because stone is extremely heavy, the sculptor must have the special equipment required for maneuvering even small blocks into position for carving. A wood-carver requires a supply of well-seasoned timber and may keep a quantity of logs and blocks in store. A modeler needs a good supply of clay of the right kind. For large terra-cottas he or she may require a specially made-up clay body, or he or she may work at a brickworks, using the local clay and firing in the brick kilns.",
  "The main part of the sculptor\u2019s work, the shaping of the material itself by modeling, carving, or constructional techniques, may be a long and arduous process, perhaps extending over a number of years and requiring assistants. Much of the work, especially architectural decoration, may be carried out at the site, or in situ.",
  "To improve its weathering qualities, to bring out the characteristics of its material to the best advantage, or to make it more decorative or realistic, sculpture is usually given a special surface finish. It may be rubbed down and polished, patinated, metal plated, gilded, painted, inlaid with other materials, and so on.",
  "Finally, the installation of sculpture may be a complex and important part of the work. The positioning and fixing of large architectural sculpture may involve cooperation with builders and engineers; fountains may involve elaborate plumbing; the design and placing of outdoor bases, or plinths, in relation to the site and the spectator may require careful thought. The choice of the materials, shape, and proportions of the base even for a small work requires a considerable amount of care.",
  "Whatever material is used, the essential features of the direct method of carving are the same; the sculptor starts with a solid mass of material and reduces it systematically to the desired form. After he or she has blocked out the main masses and planes that define the outer limits of the forms, he or she works progressively over the whole sculpture, first carving the larger containing forms and planes and then the smaller ones until eventually the surface details are reached. Then the artist gives the surface whatever finish is required. Even with a preliminary model as a guide, the sculptor\u2019s concept constantly evolves and clarifies as the work proceeds; thus, as he or she adapts the design to the nature of the carving process and the material, the work develops as an organic whole.",
  " bce  The process of direct carving imposes a characteristic order on the forms of sculpture. The faces of the original block, slab, or cylinder of material can usually still be sensed, existing around the finished work as a kind of implied spatial envelope limiting the extension of the forms in space and connecting their highest points across space. In a similar way, throughout the whole carving, smaller forms and planes can be seen as contained within implied larger ones. Thus, an ordered sequence of containing forms and planes, from the largest to the smallest, gives unity to the work.",
  "All of the great sculptural traditions of the past used the direct method of carving, but in Western civilization during the 19th and early 20th centuries it became customary for stone and, to a lesser extent, wood sculpture to be produced by the indirect method. This required the production of a finished clay model that was subsequently cast in plaster and then reproduced in stone or wood in a more or less mechanical way by means of a pointing machine (see Pointing below). Usually the carving was not done by the sculptor him- or herself. At its worst, this procedure results in a carved copy of a design that was conceived in terms of clay modeling. Although indirect carving does not achieve aesthetic qualities that are typical of carved sculpture, it does not necessarily result in bad sculpture. Rodin\u2019s marble sculptures, for example, are generally considered great works of art even by those who object to the indirect methods by which they were produced. The indirect method has been steadily losing ground since the revival of direct carving in the early 20th century and such innovations as 3D printing at the end of that century.",
  "  The tools used for carving differ with the material to be carved. Stone is carved mostly with steel tools that resemble cold chisels. To knock off the corners and angles of a block, a tool called a pitcher is driven into the surface with a heavy iron hammer. The pitcher is a thick, chisel-like tool with a wide beveled edge that breaks rather than cuts the stone. The heavy point then does the main roughing out, followed by the fine point, which may be used to within a short distance of the final surface. These pointed tools are hammered into the surface at an angle that causes the stone to break off in chips of varying sizes. Claw chisels, which have toothed edges, may then be worked in all directions over the surface, removing the stone in granule form and thus refining the surface forms. Flat chisels are used for finishing the surface carving and for cutting sharp detail. There are many other special tools, including stone gouges, drills, toothed hammers (known as bushhammers or bouchardes), and, often used today, power-driven pneumatic tools, for pounding away the surface of the stone. The surface can be polished with a variety of processes and materials.",
  " bce  Because medieval carvers worked mostly in softer stones and made great use of flat chisels, their work tends to have an edgy, cut quality and to be freely and deeply carved. In contrast is the work done in hard stones by people who lacked metal tools hard enough to cut the stone. Egyptian granite sculpture, for example, was produced mainly by abrasion; that is, by pounding the surface and rubbing it down with abrasive materials. The result is a compact sculpture, not deeply hollowed out, with softened edges and flowing surfaces. It usually has a high degree of tactile appeal.",
  "Although the process of carving is fundamentally the same for wood or stone, the physical structure of wood demands tools of a different type. For the first blocking out of a wood carving a sculptor may use saws and axes, but his or her principal tools are a wide range of wood-carver\u2019s gouges. The sharp, curved edge of a gouge cuts easily through the bundles of fibre and when used properly will not split the wood. Flat chisels are also used, especially for carving sharp details. Wood rasps, or coarse files, and sandpaper can be used to give the surface a smooth finish, or, if preferred, it can be left with a faceted, chiseled appearance. Wood-carving tools have hardwood handles and are struck with round, wooden mallets. African wood sculptors use a variety of adzes rather than gouges and mallets. Ivory is carved with an assortment of saws, knives, rasps, files, chisels, drills, and scrapers.",
  "In contrast to the reductive process of carving, modeling is essentially a building-up process in which the sculpture grows organically from the inside. Numerous plastic materials are used for modeling. The main ones are clay, plaster, and wax; but concrete, synthetic resins, plastic wood, stucco, and even molten metal can also be modeled. A design modeled in plastic materials may be intended for reproduction by casting in more permanent and rigid materials, such as metal, plaster, concrete, and fibreglass, or it may itself be made rigid and more permanent through the self-setting properties of its materials (for example, plaster) or by firing.",
  "The material most widely used for making positive models for casting is clay. A small, compact design or a low relief can be modeled solidly in clay without any internal support; but a large clay model must be formed over a strong armature made of wood and metal. Since the armature may be very elaborate and can only be altered slightly, if at all, once work has started, the modeler must have a fairly clear idea from his or her drawings and maquettes of the arrangement of the main shapes of the finished model. The underlying main masses of the sculpture are built up firmly over the armature, and then the smaller forms, surface modeling, and details are modeled over them. The modeler\u2019s chief tools are his or her fingers, but for fine work he or she may use a variety of wooden modeling tools to apply the clay and wire loop tools to cut it away. Reliefs are modeled on a vertical or nearly vertical board. The clay is keyed, or secured, onto the board with galvanized nails or wood laths. The amount of armature required depends on the height of the relief and the weight of clay involved.",
  "To make a cast in metal, a foundry requires from the sculptor a model made of a rigid material, usually plaster. The sculptor can produce this either by modeling in clay and then casting in plaster from the clay model or by modeling directly in plaster. For direct plaster modeling, a strong armature is required because the material is brittle. The main forms may be built up roughly over the armature in expanded wire and then covered in plaster-soaked scrim (a loosely woven sacking). This provides a hollow base for the final modeling, which is done by applying plaster with metal spatulas and by scraping and cutting down with rasps and chisels.",
  "Fibreglass and concrete sculptures are cast in plaster molds taken from the sculptor\u2019s original model. The model is usually clay rather than plaster because if the forms of the sculpture are at all complex it is easier to remove a plaster mold from a soft clay model than from a model in a rigid material, such as plaster.",
  "A great deal of the metal sculpture of the past, including Nigerian, Indian, and many Renaissance bronzes, was produced by the direct lost-wax process, which involves a special modeling technique (see Casting and molding below). The design is first modeled in some refractory material to within a fraction of an inch of the final surface, and then the final modeling is done in a layer of wax, using the fingers and also metal tools, which can be heated to make the wax more pliable. Medallions are often produced from wax originals, but because of their small size they can be solid-cast and therefore do not require a core.",
  "To withstand the stresses of firing, a large pottery sculpture must be hollow and of an even thickness. There are two main ways of achieving this. In the process of hollow modeling, which is typical of the potter\u2019s approach to form, the main forms of the clay model are built up directly as hollow forms with walls of a roughly even thickness. The methods of building are similar to those employed for making hand-built pottery\u2014coiling, pinching, and slabbing. The smaller forms and details are then added, and the finished work is allowed to dry out slowly and thoroughly before firing. The process of solid modeling is more typical of the sculptor\u2019s traditional approach to form. The sculpture is modeled in solid clay, sometimes over a carefully considered armature, by the sculptor\u2019s usual methods of clay modeling. Then it is cut open and hollowed out, and the armature, if there is one, is removed. The pieces are then rejoined and the work is dried out and fired.",
  "The process of modeling affects the design of sculpture in three important ways. First, the forms of the sculpture tend to be ordered from the inside. There are no external containing forms and planes, as in carved sculpture. The overall design of the work\u2014its main volumes, proportions, and axial arrangement\u2014is determined by the underlying forms; and the smaller forms, surface modeling, and decorative details are all formed around and sustained by this underlying structure. Second, because its extension into space is not limited by the dimensions of a block of material, modeled sculpture tends to be much freer and more expansive in its spatial design than carved sculpture. If the tensile strength of metal is to be exploited in the finished work, there is almost unlimited freedom; designs for brittle materials such as concrete or plaster are more limited. Third, the plasticity of clay and wax encourages a fluent, immediate kind of manipulation, and many sculptors, such as Auguste Rodin, Giacomo Manz\u00f9 , and Sir Jacob Epstein , like to preserve this record of their direct handling of the medium in their finished work. Their approach contrasts with that of the Benin and Indian bronze sculptors, who refined the surfaces of their work to remove all traces of personal \u201chandwriting.\u201d",
  " Monogram Monogram  A constructed or assembled sculpture is made by joining preformed pieces of material. It differs radically in principle from carved and modeled sculpture, both of which are fabricated out of a homogeneous mass of material. Constructed sculpture is made out of such basic preformed components as metal tubes, rods, plates, bars, and sheets; wooden laths, planks, dowels, and blocks; laminated timbers and chipboards; sheets of Perspex, Formica, and glass; fabrics; and wires and threads. These are cut to various sizes and may be either shaped before they are assembled or used as they are. The term assemblage is usually reserved for constructed sculpture that incorporates any of a vast array of ready-made, so-called found objects, such as old boilers, typewriters, engine components, mirrors, chairs, and table legs and other bits of old furniture. Numerous techniques are employed for joining these components, most of them derived from crafts other than traditional sculptural ones; for example, metal welding and brazing, wood joinery, bolting, screwing, riveting, nailing, and bonding with new powerful adhesives.",
  "The use of constructional techniques to produce sculpture is the main technical development of the art in recent years. Among the reasons for its popularity are that it lends itself readily to an emphasis on the spatial aspects of sculpture that preoccupied so many 20th-century artists; it is quicker than carving and modeling; it is considered by many sculptors and critics to be especially appropriate to a technological civilization; it is opening up new fields of imagery and new types of symbolism and form.",
  "For constructed \u201cgallery\u201d sculpture, almost any materials and techniques are likely to be used, and the products are often extremely ephemeral. But architectural sculpture, outdoor sculpture, and indeed any sculpture that is actually used must be constructed in a safe and at least reasonably permanent manner. The materials and techniques employed are therefore somewhat restricted. Metal sculpture constructed by riveting, bolting, and, above all, welding and brazing is best for outdoor use.",
  "The introduction of the oxyacetylene welding torch as a sculptor\u2019s tool revolutionized metal sculpture in the 20th century. A combination of welding and forging techniques was pioneered by the Spanish sculptor Julio Gonz\u00e1lez around 1930; and during the 1940s and 1950s it became a major sculptural technique, particularly in Britain and in the United States, where its greatest exponent was David Smith. In the 1960s and early 1970s, more sophisticated electric welding processes were replacing flame welding.",
  "Welding equipment can be used for joining and cutting metal. A welded joint is made by melting and fusing together the surfaces of two pieces of metal, usually with the addition of a small quantity of the same metal as a filler. The metal most widely used for welded sculpture is mild steel, but other metals can be welded. In a brazed joint, the parent metals are not actually fused together but are joined by an alloy that melts at a lower temperature than the parent metals. Brazing is particularly useful for making joints between different kinds of metal, which cannot be done by welding, and for joining nonferrous metals. Forging is the direct shaping of metal by bending, hammering, and cutting.",
  "Direct metalworking techniques have opened up whole new ranges of form to the sculptor\u2014open skeletal structures, linear and highly extended forms, and complex, curved sheet forms. Constructed metal sculpture may be precise and clean, as that of Minimalist sculptors Donald Judd and Phillip King, or it may exploit the textural effects of molten metal in a free, \u201cromantic\u201d manner, as in the work of Lee Bontecou .",
  "Casting and molding processes are used in sculpture either for making copies of existing sculpture or as essential stages in the production of a finished work. Numerous materials are used for making molds and casts, and some of the methods are complex and highly skilled. Only a broad outline of the principal methods can be given here.",
  "These are used for producing a single cast from a soft, plastic original, usually clay. They are especially useful for producing master casts for subsequent reproduction in metal. The basic procedure is as follows. First, the mold is built up in liquid plaster over the original clay model; for casting reliefs, a one-piece mold may be sufficient, but for sculpture in the round a mold in at least two sections is required. Second, when the plaster is set, the mold is divided and removed from the clay model. Third, the mold is cleaned, reassembled, and filled with a self-setting material such as plaster, concrete, or fibreglass-reinforced resin. Fourth, the mold is carefully chipped away from the cast. This involves the destruction of the mold\u2014hence the term \u201cwaste\u201d mold. The order of reassembling and filling the mold may be reversed; fibreglass and resin, for example, are \u201claid up\u201d in the mold pieces before they are reassembled.",
  "Plaster piece molds are used for producing more than one cast from a soft or rigid original and are especially good for reproducing existing sculpture and for slip casting (see below). Before the invention of flexible molds (see below), piece molds were used for producing wax casts for metal casting by the lost-wax process. A piece mold is built up in sections that can be withdrawn from the original model without damaging it. The number of sections depends on the complexity of the form and on the amount of undercutting; tens, or even hundreds, of pieces may be required for really large, complex works. The mold sections are carefully keyed together and supported by a plaster case. When the mold has been filled, it can be removed section by section from the cast and used again. Piece molding is a highly skilled and laborious process.",
  "Made of such materials as gelatin, vinyl, and rubber, flexible molds are used for producing more than one cast; they offer a much simpler alternative to piece molding when the original model is a rigid one with complex forms and undercuts. The material is melted and poured around the original positive in sections, if necessary. Being flexible, the mold easily pulls away from a rigid surface without causing damage. While it is being filled (with wax, plaster, concrete, and fibreglass-reinforced resins), the mold must be surrounded by a plaster case to prevent distortion.",
  "The lost-wax process is the traditional method of casting metal sculpture. It requires a positive, which consists of a core made of a refractory material and an outer layer of wax. The positive can be produced either by direct modeling in wax over a prepared core, in which case the process is known as direct lost-wax casting, or by casting in a piece mold or flexible mold taken from a master cast. The wax positive is invested with a mold made of refractory materials and is then heated to a temperature that will drive off all moisture and melt out all the wax, leaving a narrow cavity between the core and the investment. Molten metal is then poured into this cavity. When the metal has cooled down and solidified, the investment is broken away, and the core is removed from inside the cast. The process is, of course, much more complex than this simple outline suggests. Care has to be taken to suspend the core within the mold by means of metal pins, and a structure of channels must be made in the mold that will enable the metal to reach all parts of the cavity and permit the mold gases to escape. A considerable amount of filing and chasing of the cast is usually required after casting is completed.",
  "While the lost-wax process is used for producing complex, refined metal castings, sand molding is more suitable for simpler types of form and for sculpture in which a certain roughness of surface does not matter. Recent improvements in the quality of sand castings and the invention of the \u201clost-pattern\u201d process (see below) have resulted in a much wider use of sand casting as a means of producing sculpture. A sand mold, made of special sand held together by a binder, is built up around a rigid positive, usually in a number of sections held together in metal boxes. For a hollow casting, a core is required that will fit inside the negative mold, leaving a narrow cavity as in the lost-wax process. The molten metal is poured into this cavity.",
  "The lost-pattern process is used for the production by sand molding of single casts in metal. After a positive made of expanded polystyrene is firmly embedded in casting sand, molten metal is poured into the mold straight onto the expanded foam original. The heat of the metal causes the foam to pass off into vapour and disappear, leaving a negative mold to be filled by the metal. Channels for the metal to run in and for the gases to escape are made in the mold, as in the lost-wax process. The method is used mainly for producing solid castings in aluminum that can be welded or riveted together to make the finished sculpture.",
  "Slip casting is primarily a potter\u2019s technique that can be used for repetition casting of small pottery sculptures. Liquid clay, or slip, is poured into a plaster piece mold. Some of the water in the slip is absorbed by the plaster and a layer of stiffened clay collects on the surface of the mold. When this layer is thick enough to form a cast, the excess slip is poured off and the mold is removed. The hollow clay cast is then dried and fired.",
  "Simple casts for pottery sculpture\u2014mainly tiles and low reliefs\u2014can be prepared by pressing clay into a rigid mold. More complex forms can be built up from a number of separately press-cast pieces. Simple terra-cotta molds can be made by pressing clay around a rigid positive form. After firing, these press molds can be used for press casting.",
  "A sculpture can be reproduced by transposing measurements taken all over its surface to a copy. The process is made accurate and thorough by the use of a pointing machine, which is an arrangement of adjustable metal arms and pointers that are set to the position of any point on the surface of a three-dimensional form and then used to locate the corresponding point on the surface of a copy. If the copy is a stone one, the block is drilled to the depth measured by the pointing machine. When a number of points have been fixed by drilling, the stone is cut away to the required depth. For accurate pointing, a vast number of points have to be taken, and the final surface is approached gradually. The main use of pointing has been for the indirect method of carving.",
  "Enlarged and reduced copies of sculpture can also be produced with the aid of mechanical devices. A sophisticated reducing machine that works on the principle of the pantograph (an instrument for copying on any predetermined scale, consisting of four light, rigid bars jointed in parallelogram form) is used in minting for scaling down the sculptor\u2019s original model to coin size.",
  "Surface finishes for sculpture can be either natural\u2014bringing the material of the sculpture itself to a finish\u2014or applied. Almost all applied surface finishes preserve as well as decorate.",
  "Many sculptural materials have a natural beauty of colour and texture that can be brought out by smoothing and polishing. Stone carvings are smoothed by rubbing down with a graded series of coarse and fine abrasives, such as carborundum, sandstone, emery, pumice, and whiting, all used while the stone is wet. Some stones, such as marble and granite, will take a high gloss; others are too coarse-grained to be polished and can only be smoothed to a granular finish. Wax is sometimes used to give stone a final polish.",
  "The natural beauty of wood is brought out by sandpapering or scraping and then waxing or oiling. Beeswax and linseed oil are the traditional materials, but a wide range of waxes and oils is currently available.",
  "Ivory is polished with gentle abrasives such as pumice and whiting, applied with a damp cloth.",
  "Concrete can be rubbed down, like stone, with water and abrasives, which both smooth the surface and expose the aggregate. Some concretes can be polished.",
  "Metals are rubbed down manually with steel wool and emery paper and polished with various metal polishes. A high-gloss polish can be given to metals by means of power-driven buffing wheels used in conjunction with abrasives and polishes. Clear lacquers are applied to preserve the polish.",
  "Stone, wood, terra-cotta, metal, fibreglass, and plaster can all be painted in a reasonably durable manner provided that the surfaces are properly prepared and suitable primings and paints are used. In the past, stone and wood carvings were often finished with a coating of gesso (plaster of paris or gypsum prepared with glue) that served both as a final modeling material for delicate surface detail and as a priming for painting. Historically, the painting and gilding of sculpture were usually left to specialists. In Greek relief sculpture, actual details of the composition were often omitted at the carving stage and left for the painter to insert. In the 15th century, the great Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden undertook the painting of sculpture as part of his work.",
  "Modern paint technology has made an enormous range of materials available. Constructed sculptures are often finished with mechanical grinders and sanders and then sprayed with high-quality cellulose paints.",
  " Gates of Paradise Isaac, Jacob, and Esau Gates of Paradise  The surfaces of wood, stone, and plaster sculpture can be decorated with gold, silver, and other metals that are applied in leaf or powder form over a suitable priming. Metals, especially bronze, were often fire-gilded; that is, treated with an amalgam of gold and mercury that was heated to drive off the mercury. The panels of the Gates of Paradise in Florence, by the 15th-century sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti , are a well-known example of gilded bronze.",
  "Patinas on metals are caused by the corrosive action of chemicals. Sculpture that is exposed to different kinds of atmosphere or buried in soil or immersed in seawater for some time acquires a patina that can be extremely attractive. Similar effects can be achieved artificially by applying various chemicals to the metal surface, which is often heated to create a bond. This is a particularly effective treatment for bronze, which can be given a wide variety of attractive green, brown, blue, and black patinas. Iron is sometimes allowed to rust until it acquires a satisfactory colour, and then the process is arrested by lacquering.",
  "The surfaces of metal sculpture or of specially prepared nonmetal sculpture can be coated with such metals as chrome, silver, gold, copper, and nickel by the familiar industrial process of electroplating. The related technique of anodizing can be used to prevent the corrosion of aluminum sculpture and to dye its surface.",
  "The surfaces of metal sculpture can be decorated by means of numerous metalsmithing techniques\u2014etching, engraving, metal inlaying, enameling, and so on. Pottery sculpture can be decorated with coloured slips, oxides, and enamels; glazed with a variety of shiny or mat glazes; and brought to a dull polish by burnishing.",
  "Other materials have often been added to the surface of sculpture. The eyes of ancient figure sculpture, for example, were sometimes inlaid with stones. Occasionally\u2014as in Mexican mosaic work\u2014the whole surface of a sculpture is inlaid with mother-of-pearl, turquoise, coral, and many other substances.",
  " The Matter of Time The Matter of Time  A great deal of sculpture is designed to be placed in public squares, gardens, parks, and similar open places or in interior positions where it is isolated in space and can be viewed from all directions. Other sculpture is carved in relief and is viewed only from the front and sides.",
  "The opportunities for free spatial design that such freestanding sculpture presents are not always fully exploited. The work may be designed, like many Archaic sculptures, to be viewed from only one or two fixed positions, or it may in effect be little more than a four-sided relief that hardly changes the three-dimensional form of the block at all. Sixteenth-century Mannerist sculptors, on the other hand, made a special point of exploiting the all-around visibility of freestanding sculpture. Giambologna\u2019s Rape of the Sabines , for example, compels the viewer to walk all around it in order to grasp its spatial design. It has no principal views; its forms move around the central axis of the composition, and their serpentine movement unfolds itself gradually as the spectator moves around to follow them. Much of the sculpture of Henry Moore and other 20th-century sculptors is not concerned with movement of this kind, nor is it designed to be viewed from any fixed positions. Rather, it is a freely designed structure of multidirectional forms that is opened up, pierced, and extended in space in such a way that the viewer is made aware of its all-around design largely by seeing through the sculpture. The majority of constructed sculptures are disposed in space with complete freedom and invite viewing from all directions. In many instances the spectator can actually walk under and through them.",
  "The way in which a freestanding sculpture makes contact with the ground or with its base is a matter of considerable importance. A reclining figure, for example, may in effect be a horizontal relief. It may blend with the ground plane and appear to be rooted in the ground like an outcrop of rock. Other sculptures, including some reclining figures, may be designed in such a way that they seem to rest on the ground and to be independent of their base. Others are supported in space above the ground. The most completely freestanding sculptures are those that have no base and may be picked up, turned in the hands, and literally viewed all around like a netsuke (a small toggle of wood, ivory, or metal used to fasten a small pouch or purse to a kimono sash). Of course, a large sculpture cannot actually be picked up in this way, but it can be designed so as to invite the viewer to think of it as a detached, independent object that has no fixed base and is designed all around.",
  " Apollo and Daphne Apollo and Daphne  Sculpture designed to stand against a wall or similar background or in a niche may be in the round and freestanding in the sense that it is not attached to its background like a relief; but it does not have the spatial independence of completely freestanding sculpture, and it is not designed to be viewed all around. It must be designed so that its formal structure and the nature and meaning of its subject matter can be clearly apprehended from a limited range of frontal views. The forms of the sculpture, therefore, are usually spread out mainly in a lateral direction rather than in depth. Greek pedimental sculpture illustrates this approach superbly: the composition is spread out in a plane perpendicular to the viewer\u2019s line of sight and is made completely intelligible from the front. Seventeenth-century Baroque sculptors, especially Bernini, adopted a rather different approach. Though some favoured a coherent frontal viewpoint, however active, Bernini is known to have conceived a work (the Apollo and Daphne [1622\u201324]) in which the narrative unfolded in details discovered as the viewer walked around the work, beginning from the rear.",
  "The frontal composition of wall and niche sculpture does not necessarily imply any lack of three-dimensionality in the forms themselves; it is only the arrangement of the forms that is limited. Classical pedimental sculpture, Indian temple sculpture such as that at Khajuraho , Gothic niche sculpture, and Michelangelo\u2019s Medici tomb figures are all designed to be placed against a background, but their forms are conceived with a complete fullness of volume.",
  " The Reign of Jupiter The Reign of Jupiter  Relief sculpture is a complex art form that combines many features of the two-dimensional pictorial arts and the three-dimensional sculptural arts. On the one hand, a relief, like a picture, is dependent on a supporting surface, and its composition must be extended in a plane in order to be visible. On the other hand, its three-dimensional properties are not merely represented pictorially but are in some degree actual, like those of fully developed sculpture.",
  "  Among the various types of relief are some that approach very closely the condition of the pictorial arts. The reliefs of Donatello, Ghiberti, and other early Renaissance artists make full use of perspective , which is a pictorial method of representing three-dimensional spatial relationships realistically on a two-dimensional surface. Egyptian and most pre-Columbian American low reliefs are also extremely pictorial but in a different way. Using a system of graphic conventions, they translate the three-dimensional world into a two-dimensional one. The relief image is essentially one of plane surfaces and could not possibly exist in three dimensions. Its only sculptural aspects are its slight degree of actual projection from a surface and its frequently subtle surface modeling.",
  "Other types of relief\u2014for example, Classical Greek and most Indian\u2014are conceived primarily in sculptural terms. The figures inhabit a space that is defined by the solid forms of the figures themselves and is limited by the background plane. This back plane is treated as a finite, impenetrable barrier in front of which the figures exist. It is not conceived as a receding perspective space or environment within which the figures are placed nor as a flat surface upon which they are placed. The reliefs, so to speak, are more like contracted sculpture than expanded pictures.",
  "The central problem of relief sculpture is to contract or condense three-dimensional solid form and spatial relations into a limited depth space. The extent to which the forms actually project varies considerably, and reliefs are classified on this basis as low reliefs (bas-reliefs) or high reliefs. There are types of reliefs that form a continuous series from the almost completely pictorial to the almost fully in the round.",
  "One of the relief sculptor\u2019s most difficult tasks is to represent the relations between forms in depth within the limited space available to him. He does this mainly by giving careful attention to the planes of the relief. In a carved relief the highest, or front, plane is defined by the surface of the slab of wood or stone in which the relief is carved; and the back plane is the surface from which the forms project. The space between these two planes can be thought of as divided into a series of planes, one behind the other. The relations of forms in depth can then be thought of as relations between forms lying in different planes.",
  "Sunken relief is also known as incised, coelanaglyphic, and intaglio relief. It is almost exclusively an ancient Egyptian art form, but some beautiful small-scale Indian examples in ivory have been discovered at Bagr\u0101m in Afghanistan. In a sunken relief, the outline of the design is first incised all around. The relief is then carved inside the incised outline, leaving the surrounding surface untouched. Thus, the finished relief is sunk below the level of the surrounding surface and is contained within a sharp, vertical-walled contour line. This approach to relief sculpture preserves the continuity of the material\u2019s original surface and creates no projection from it. The outline shows up as a powerful line of light and shade around the whole design.",
  " bce  Figurative low relief is generally regarded by sculptors as an extremely difficult art form. To give a convincing impression of three-dimensional structure and surface modeling with only a minimal degree of projection demands a fusion of draftsmanship and carving or modeling skill of a high order. The sculptor has to proceed empirically, constantly changing the direction of his or her light and testing the optical effect of the work. The artist cannot follow any fixed rules or represent things in depth by simply scaling down measurements mathematically, so that, say, one inch of relief space represents one foot.",
  "The forms of low relief usually make contact with the background all around their contours. If there is a slight amount of undercutting, its purpose is to give emphasis, by means of cast shadow, to a contour rather than to give any impression that the forms are independent of their background. Low relief includes figures that project up to about half their natural circumference.",
  "Technically, the simplest kind of low relief is the two-plane relief. For this, the sculptor draws an outline on a surface and then cuts away the surrounding surface, leaving the figure raised as a flat silhouette above the background plane. This procedure is often used for the first stages of a full relief carving, in which case the sculptor will proceed to carve into the raised silhouette, rounding the forms and giving an impression of three-dimensional structure. In a two-plane relief, however, the silhouette is left flat and substantially unaltered except for the addition of surface detail. Pre-Columbian sculptors used this method of relief carving to create bold figurative and abstract reliefs.",
  "Stiacciato relief is an extremely subtle type of flat, low relief carving that is especially associated with the 15th-century sculptors Donatello and Desiderio da Settignano. The design is partly drawn with finely engraved chisel lines and partly carved in relief. The stiacciato technique depends largely for its effect on the way in which pale materials, such as white marble, respond to light and show up the most delicate lines and subtle changes of texture or relief.",
  "The forms of high relief project far enough to be in some degree independent of their background. As they approach the fullness of sculpture in the round, they become of necessity considerably undercut. In many high reliefs, where parts of the composition are completely detached from their background and fully in the round, it is often impossible to tell from the front whether or not a figure is actually attached to its background.",
  "Many different degrees of projection are often combined in one relief composition. Figures in the foreground may be completely detached and fully in the round, while those in the middle distance are in about half relief and those in the background in low relief. Such effects are common in late Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque sculpture.",
  "Since the 1950s, many new combined forms of art have been developed that do not fit readily into any of the traditional categories. Two of the most important of these, environments and kinetics, are closely enough connected with sculpture to be regarded by many artists and critics as branches or offshoots of sculpture.",
  "Traditional sculptures in relief and in the round are static, fixed objects or images. Their immobility and immutability are part of the permanence traditionally associated with the art of sculpture, especially monumental sculpture. What one refers to as movement in, say, a Baroque or Greek sculpture is not actual physical motion but a movement that is either directly represented in the subject matter (galloping horses) or expressed through the dynamic character of its form (spirals, undulating curves). In the 20th century, however, the use of actual movement, kineticism, became an important aspect of sculpture. Naum Gabo , Marcel Duchamp , L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy , and Alexander Calder were pioneers of kinetic sculpture in modern times, but many kinetic artists see a connection between their work and such forms as the moving toys, dolls, and clocks of previous ages.",
  "There are now types of sculpture in which the components are moved by air currents, as in the well-known mobiles of Calder; by water; by magnetism, the speciality of Nicholus Takis; by a variety of electromechanical devices; or by the participation of the spectator himself. The neo-Dada satire quality of the kinetic sculpture created during the 1960s is exemplified by the works of Jean Tinguely. His self-destructing \u201cHomage to New York\u201d perfected the concept of a sculpture being both an object and an event, or \u201chappening.\u201d",
  "The aim of most kinetic sculptors is to make movement itself an integral part of the design of the sculpture and not merely to suggest movement within a static object. Calder\u2019s mobiles, for example, depend for their aesthetic effect on constantly changing patterns of relationship. When liquids and gases are used as components, the shapes and dimensions of the sculpture may undergo continual transformations. The movement of smoke; the diffusion and flow of coloured water, mercury, oil, and so on; pneumatic inflation and deflation; and the movement of masses of bubbles have all served as media for kinetic sculpture. In the complex, electronically controlled \u201cspatio-dynamic\u201d and \u201clumino-dynamic\u201d constructions of Nicolas Sch\u00f6ffer , the projection of changing patterns of light into space is a major feature.",
  "The environmental sculptor creates new spatial contexts that differ from anything developed by traditional sculpture. The work no longer confronts the spectator as an object but surrounds him so that he moves within it as he might within a stage set, a garden, or an interior. The most common type of environment is the \u201croom,\u201d which may have specially shaped and surfaced walls, special lighting effects, and many different kinds of contents. Kurt Schwitters\u2019s Merzbau (destroyed in 1943) was the first of these rooms, which now include the nightmare fantasy of Edward Kienholz\u2019s tableaux, such as Roxy\u2019s (1961) or The Illegal Operation (1962); George Segal\u2019s compositions, in which casts of clothed human figures in frozen, casual attitudes are placed in interiors; and rooms built of mirrors, such as Yayoi Kusama \u2019s Endless Love Room and Lucas Samaras\u2019s Mirrored Room , in both of which the spectator himself, endlessly reflected, becomes part of the total effect.",
  " The Gates The Gates  Environmental art, in common with collage and assemblage, has tended toward greater concreteness not by making a more realistic representation, as naturalistic art does, but by including more of reality itself in the work; for example, by using casts taken from the actual human body, real clothes, actual objects and casts of objects, actual lighting effects, and real items of furniture. Plastic elements may be combined with music and sound effects, dance, theatrical spectacles, and film to create so-called happenings, in which real figures are constituents of the \u201cartwork\u201d and operations are performed not on \u201cartistic\u201d materials but are performed on real objects and on the actual environment. Ideas such as these go far beyond anything that has ever before been associated with the term sculpture.",
  "Sculpture in the round is much more restricted than relief in the range of its subject matter. The representation of, say, a battle scene or a cavalcade in the round would require a space that corresponded in scale in every direction with that occupied by an actual battle or cavalcade. No such problems arise in relief because the treatment of scale and relations in depth is to some extent notional, or theoretical, like that of pictures. Then again, because a relief is attached to a background, problems of weight and physical balance and support do not arise. Figures can be represented as floating in space and can be arranged vertically as well as horizontally. Thus, in general, sculpture in the round is concerned with single figures and limited groups, while reliefs deal with more complex \u201cpictorial\u201d subjects involving crowds, landscape, architectural backgrounds, and so on.",
  "The principal subject of sculpture has always been the human figure. Next in importance in historical work are animals and fantastic creatures based on human and animal forms. Other subjects\u2014for example, landscape, plants, still life, and architecture\u2014have served primarily as accessories to figure sculpture, not as subjects in their own right, except as decorative elements within architecture or as precious carved witticisms such as those of the British wood-carver Grinling Gibbons . The overwhelming predominance of the human figure is due: first, to its immense emotional importance as an object of desire, love, fear, respect, and, in the case of anthropomorphic gods, worship; and, second, to its inexhaustible subtlety and variety of form and expression. The nude or almost nude figure played a prominent role in Egyptian, Indian, Greek, and African sculpture, while in medieval European and ancient Chinese sculpture the figure is almost invariably clothed. The interplay of the linear and modeled forms of free draperies with the solid volumes of the human body was of great interest to Classical sculptors and later became one of the principal themes of Renaissance and post-Renaissance sculpture. The human figure continues to be of central importance in modern sculpture in spite of the growth of nonfigurative art; but the optimistic, idealized, or naturalistic images of man prevalent in previous ages have been largely replaced by images of despair, horror, deformation, and satire.",
  "The production of devotional images has been one of the sculptor\u2019s main tasks, and many of the world\u2019s greatest sculptures are of this kind. They include images of Buddha and the Hindu gods; of Christ, the Virgin, and the Christian saints; of Athena , Aphrodite , Zeus , and other Greek gods; and of all the various gods, spirits, and mythical beings of Rome, the ancient Near East, pre-Columbian America, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.",
  "  Closely connected with devotional images are all of the commemorative narrative sculptures in which legends, heroic deeds, and religious stories are depicted for the delight and instruction of peoples who lived when books and literacy were rare. The Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian traditions are especially rich in narrative sculpture. Stories of the incarnations of Buddha\u2014 Jataka \u2014and of the Hindu gods abounded in the temple sculpture of India and Southeast Asia; for example, at Sanchi, Amaravati, Borobudur, and Angkor. Sculpture illustrating the stories of the Bible is so abundant in medieval churches that the churches have been called \u201cBibles in stone.\u201d Sculpture recounting the heroic deeds of kings and generals are common, especially in Assyria and Rome. The Romans made use of a form known as continuous narrative, the best known example of which is the spiral, or helical, band of relief sculpture that surrounds Trajan\u2019s Column (c. 106\u2013113 ce ) and tells the story of the Emperor\u2019s Dacian Wars. The episodes in the narrative are not separated into a series of framed compositions but are linked to form a continuous band of unbroken relief.",
  "Portraiture was practiced by the Egyptians but was comparatively rare in the ancient world until the Greeks and Romans made portrait sculpture one of their major artistic achievements. The features of many famous people are known to modern man only through the work of Roman sculptors on coins and medals, portrait busts, and full-length portraits. Portraiture has been an important aspect of Western sculpture from the Renaissance to the present day. Some of the best known modern portrait sculptors are Rodin, Charles Despiau , Augusta Savage , Marino Marini , and Jacob Epstein.",
  "Scenes of everyday life have been represented in sculpture mainly on a small scale in minor works. The sculptures that are closest in spirit to the quiet dignity of the great 17th- and 18th-century genre paintings of Johannes Vermeer and Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin are perhaps certain Greek tombstones, such as that of the Stele of Hegeso, which represents a quiet, absorbed moment when a seated young woman and her maidservant are looking at a necklace they have just removed from a casket. Intimate scenes of the people and their activities in everyday rural life are often portrayed in medieval and Egyptian reliefs as part of larger compositions.",
  "Animals have always been important subjects for sculpture. Paleolithic man produced some extraordinarily sensitive animal sculptures both in relief and in the round. Representations of horses and lions are among the finest works of Assyrian sculpture. Egyptian sculptors produced sensitive naturalistic representations of cattle, donkeys, hippopotamuses, apes, and a wide variety of birds and fish. Ancient Chinese sculptors made superb small-scale animal sculptures in bronze and pottery. Animals were the main subject matter for the sculpture of the nomadic tribes of Eurasia and northern Europe, for whom they became the basis for elaborate zoomorphic fantasies. This animal art contributed to the rich tradition of animal sculpture in medieval art. Animals also served as a basis for semi-abstract fantasy in Mexican, Maya, North American Indian, and Oceanic sculpture. The horse has always occupied an important place in Western sculpture, but other animals have also figured in the work of such sculptors as Giambologna, in the 16th century, and Antoine-Louis Barye, in the 19th, as well as numerous sculptors of garden and fountain pieces. Among modern sculptors who have made extensive use of animals or animal-like forms are Constantin Brancusi , Pablo Picasso , Gerhard Marcks , Germaine Richier , Fran\u00e7ois Pompon, Pino Pascali, and Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier-Maxime Lalanne.",
  "In their attempts to imagine gods and mythical beings, sculptors have invented fantastic images based on the combination and metamorphosis of animal and human forms. A centaur , the Minotaur , and animal-headed gods of the ancient world are straightforward combinations. More imaginative fantasies were produced by Mexican and Maya sculptors and by other sculptors in many parts of the world. Fantastic creatures abound in the sculpture produced in northern Europe during the early Middle Ages and the Romanesque period. Fantasy of a playful kind is often found in garden sculpture and fountains.",
  "In the period following World War I , fantasy was a dominant element in representational sculpture. Among its many forms are images derived from dreams, the technological fantasy of science fiction, erotic fantasies, and a whole host of monsters and automata. The Surrealists have made a major contribution to this aspect of modern sculpture.",
  "Architectural backgrounds in sculpture range from the simplified baldacchinos (ornamental structures resembling canopies used especially over altars) of early medieval reliefs to the 17th- and 18th-century virtuoso perspective townscapes of Grinling Gibbons . Architectural accessories such as plinths, entablatures , pilasters, columns, and moldings have played a prominent role both in Greek and Roman sarcophagi, in medieval altarpieces and screens, and in Renaissance wall tombs.",
  "Outside the field of ornament, botanical forms have played only a minor role in sculpture. Trees and stylized lotuses are especially common in Indian sculpture because of their great symbolic significance. Trees are also present in many Renaissance reliefs and in some medieval reliefs.",
  "Landscape, which was an important background feature in many Renaissance reliefs (notably those of Ghiberti) and, as sculptured rocks, appeared in a number of Baroque fountains, entered into sculpture in a new way when Henry Moore combined the forms of caves, rocks, hills, and cliffs with the human form in a series of large reclining figures.",
  " Spoonbridge and Cherry Spoonbridge and Cherry  There is nothing in sculpture comparable with the tradition of still-life painting. When objects are represented, it is almost always as part of a figure composition. A few modern sculptors, however, notably Giacomo Manz\u00f9 and Claes Oldenburg , have used still-life subjects.",
  "There are two main kinds of nonrepresentational sculpture. One kind uses nature not as subject matter to be represented but as a source of formal ideas. For sculptors who work in this way, the forms that are observed in nature serve as a starting point for a kind of creative play, the end products of which may bear little or no resemblance either to their original source or to any other natural object. Many works by Brancusi, Raymond Duchamp-Villon , Jacques Lipchitz , Henri Laurens , Umberto Boccioni , and other pioneer modern sculptors have this character. The transformation of natural forms to a point where they are no longer recognizable is also common in many styles of early and ornamental art.",
  "The other main kind of nonrepresentational sculpture, often known as nonobjective sculpture, is a more completely nonrepresentational form that does not even have a starting point in nature. It arises from a constructive manipulation of the sculptor\u2019s generalized, abstract ideas of spatial relations, volume, line, colour, texture, and so on. The approach of the nonobjective sculptor has been likened to that of the composer of music, who manipulates the elements of his or her art in a similar manner. The inclusion of purely invented, three-dimensional artifacts under the heading of sculpture is a 20th-century innovation.",
  "Some nonobjective sculptors prefer forms that have the complex curvilinearity of surface typical of living organisms; others prefer more regular, simple geometric forms. The whole realm of three-dimensional form is open to nonobjective sculptors, but these sculptors often restrict themselves to a narrow range of preferred types of form. A kind of nonobjective sculpture prominent in the 1950s and \u201960s, for example, consisted of extremely stark, so-called primary forms. These were highly finished, usually coloured constructions that were often large in scale and made up entirely of plane or single-curved surfaces. Prominent among the first generation of nonobjective sculptors were Jean Arp , Antoine Pevsner , Naum Gabo, Barbara Hepworth, Max Bill , and David Smith. Subsequent artists who worked in this manner include Robert Morris , Donald Judd, and Phillip King.",
  "The devices and motifs of ornamental sculpture fall into three main categories: abstract, zoomorphic, and botanical. Abstract shapes, which can easily be made to fit into any framework, are a widespread form of decoration. Outstanding examples of abstract relief ornament are found on Islamic, Mexican, and Maya buildings and on small Celtic metal artifacts. The character of the work varies from the large-scale rectilinear two-plane reliefs of the buildings of Mitla in Mexico, to the small-scale curvilinear plastic decoration of a Celtic shield or body ornament.",
  "Zoomorphic relief decoration, derived from a vast range of animal forms, is common on early artifacts and on Romanesque churches, especially the wooden stave churches of Scandinavia.",
  "Botanical forms lend themselves readily to decorative purposes because their growth patterns are variable and their components\u2014leaf, tendril, bud, flower, and fruit\u2014are infinitely repeatable. The acanthus and anthemion motifs of Classical relief and the lotuses of Indian relief are splendid examples of stylized plant ornament. The naturalistic leaf ornament of Southwell Minster in England, Reims Cathedral in France, and other Gothic churches transcends the merely decorative and becomes superbly plastic sculpture in its own right.",
  "Sculptural images may be symbolic on a number of levels. Apart from conventional symbols, such as those of heraldry and other insignia, the simplest and most straightforward kind of sculptural symbol is that in which an abstract idea is represented by means of allegory and personification. A few common examples are figures that personify the cardinal virtues (prudence, justice, temperance, fortitude), the theological virtues (faith, hope, and charity), the arts, the church, victory, the seasons of the year, industry, and agriculture. These figures are often provided with symbolic objects that serve to identify them; for example, the hammer of industry, the sickle of agriculture, the hourglass of time, the scales of justice. Such personifications abound in medieval and Renaissance sculpture and were until recently the stock in trade of public sculpture the world over. Animals are also frequently used in the same way; for example, the owl (as the emblem of Athens and the symbol of wisdom), the British lion, and the American eagle.",
  "  Beyond this straightforward level of symbolism, the images of sculpture may serve as broader, more abstruse religious, mythical, and civic symbols expressing some of mankind\u2019s deepest spiritual insights, beliefs, and feelings. The great tympanums (the space above the lintel of a door that is enclosed by the doorway arch) of Autun in central France, Moissac in southern France, and other medieval churches symbolize some of the most profound Christian doctrines concerning the ends of human life and man\u2019s relations with the divine. The Hindu image of the dance of Shiva is symbolic in every detail, and the whole image expresses in one concentrated symbol some of the complex cosmological ideas of the Hindu religion. The Buddhist temple of Borobudur, in Java, is one of the most complex and integrated of all religious symbols. It is designed as a holy mountain whose structure symbolizes the structure of the spiritual universe. Each of the nine levels of the temple has a different kind of sculptural symbolism, progressing from symbols of hell and the world of desire at the lowest level to austere symbols of the higher spiritual mysteries at its uppermost levels.",
  "In more individualistic societies, works of sculpture may be symbolic on a personal, private level. Michelangelo\u2019s Slaves have been interpreted as Neoplatonic allegories of the human soul struggling to free itself from the bondage of the body, its \u201cearthly prison,\u201d or, more directly, as symbols of the struggle of intelligible form against mere matter. But they could also be disturbing symbols of Michelangelo\u2019s personal attitudes, emotions, and psychological conflicts. If it is an expression of his or her unconscious mind, the sculptor him- or herself may be unaware of this aspect of the design of his or her work.",
  "Many modern sculptors disclaim any attempt at symbolism in their work. When symbolic images do play a part in modern sculpture, they are either derived from obsolete classical, medieval, and other historical sources or they are private. Because there has been little socially recognized symbolism for the modern sculptor to use in his or her work, symbols consciously invented by individual artists or deriving from the image-producing function of the individual unconscious mind have been paramount. Many of these are entirely personal symbols expressing the artist\u2019s private attitudes, beliefs, obsessions, and emotions. They are often more symptomatic than symbolic. Henry Moore is outstanding among modern sculptors for having created a world of personal symbols that also have a universal quality; and Naum Gabo has sought images that would symbolize in a general way modern man\u2019s attitudes to the world picture provided by science and technology.",
  "Examples of sculpture of which the positioning, or siting, as well as the imagery is symbolic are the carved boundary stones of the ancient world; memorials sited on battlegrounds or at places where religious and political martyrs have been killed; the Statue of Liberty and similar civic symbols situated at harbours, town gates, bridges, and so on; and the scenes of the Last Judgment placed over the entrances to cathedrals, where they could serve as an admonition to the congregation.",
  "The choice of symbolism suitable to the function of a sculpture is an important aspect of design. Fonts, pulpits, lecterns, triumphal arches, war memorials, tombstones, and the like all require a symbolism appropriate to their function. In a somewhat different way, the tomb sculptures of Egypt, intended to serve a magical function in the afterlife of the tomb\u2019s inhabitants, had to be images suitable for their purpose. These, however, are more in the nature of magical substitutes than symbols.",
  "The vast majority of sculptures are not entirely autonomous but are integrated or linked in some way with other works of art in other mediums. Relief, in particular, has served as a form of decoration for an immense range of domestic, personal, civic, and sacred artifacts, from the spear-throwers of Paleolithic man and the cosmetic palettes of earliest Egyptian civilization to the latest mass-produced plastic reproduction of a Jacobean linenfold panel (a carved or molded panel representing a fold, or scroll, of linen).",
  "The main use of large-scale sculpture has been in conjunction with architecture. It has either formed part of the interior or exterior fabric of the building itself or has been placed against or near the building as an adjunct to it. The role of sculpture in relation to buildings as part of a townscape is also of considerable importance. Traditionally, it has been used to provide a focal point at the meeting of streets, and in marketplaces, town squares, and other open places\u2014a tradition that many town planners today are continuing.",
  " Wood Line Wood Line  Sculpture has been widely used as part of the total decorative scheme for a garden or park. Garden sculpture is usually intended primarily for enjoyment, helping to create the right kind of environment for meditation, relaxation, and delight. Because the aim is to create a lighthearted arcadian or ideal paradisal atmosphere, disturbing or serious subjects are usually avoided. The sculpture may be set among trees and foliage where it can surprise and delight the viewer or sited in the open to provide a focal point for a vista.",
  "Fountains, too, are intended primarily to give enjoyment to the senses. There is nothing to compare with the interplay of light, movement, sound, and sculptural imagery in great fountains, which combine the movement and sound of sheets, jets, and cataracts of water with richly imaginative sculpture, water plants and foliage, darting fish, reflections, and changing lights. They are the prototypes of all 20th-century \u201cmixed-media\u201d kinetic sculptures.",
  "  The durability of sculpture makes it an ideal medium for commemorative purposes, and much of the world\u2019s greatest sculpture has been created to perpetuate the memory of persons and events. Commemorative sculpture includes tombs, tombstones, statues, plaques, sarcophagi, memorial columns, and triumphal arches. Portraiture, too, often serves a memorial function.",
  "One of the most familiar and widespread uses of sculpture is for coins. Produced for more than 2,500 years, these miniature works of art contain a historically invaluable and often artistically excellent range of portrait heads and symbolic devices. Medals, too, in spite of their small scale, may be vehicles for plastic art of the highest quality. The 15th-century medals of the Italian artist Antonio Pisanello and the coins of ancient Greece are generally considered the supreme achievements in these miniature fields of sculpture.",
  "Also on a small scale are the sculptural products of the glyptic arts\u2014that is, the arts of carving gems and hard stones. Superb and varied work, often done in conjunction with precious metalwork, has been produced in many countries.",
  "Finally, sculpture has been widely used for ceremonial and ritualistic objects such as bishop\u2019s croziers, censers, reliquaries, chalices, tabernacles, sacred book covers, ancient Chinese bronzes, burial accessories, the paraphernalia of tribal rituals, the special equipment worn by participants in the sacred ball game of ancient Mexico, processional images, masks and headdresses, and modern trophies and awards.",
