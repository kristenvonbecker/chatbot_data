  " c. Country Life,  gateleg table , type of table first used in England in the 16th century. The top had a fixed section and one or two hinged sections, which, when not in use, folded back onto the fixed section or were allowed to hang vertically. The hinged section, or flap, was supported on pivoted legs joined at the top and bottom by stretchers and so constituting a gate. Large flaps had two supports, which had the advantage of providing freer leg space in the centre.",
  "A variant introduced in the third quarter of the 18th century is the spider-leg table, in which the turned legs are exceptionally slender. In the 18th century, gateleg tables were popular in the American colonies, where local variations were introduced."
