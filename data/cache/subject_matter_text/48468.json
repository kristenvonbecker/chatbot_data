[
  " liquid , in phonetics, a consonant sound in which the tongue produces a partial closure in the mouth, resulting in a resonant, vowel-like consonant, such as English l and r. Liquids may be either syllabic or nonsyllabic; i.e., they may sometimes, like vowels, act as the sound carrier in a syllable. The r in \u201cfather\u201d or Czech krk \u201cneck\u201d and the l in \u201crattle\u201d are syllabic; the r in \u201crim\u201d and the l in \u201clock\u201d are nonsyllabic."
