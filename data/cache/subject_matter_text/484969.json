  " Go Tell It on the Mountain , semiautobiographical novel by James Baldwin , published in 1953. It was Baldwin\u2019s first novel and is considered his finest. Based on the author\u2019s experiences as a teenaged preacher in a small revivalist church, the novel describes two days and a long night in the life of the Grimes family, particularly 14-year-old John and his stepfather, Gabriel. It is a classic of contemporary African American literature.",
  "Baldwin\u2019s description of John\u2019s descent into the depths of his young soul was hailed as brilliant, as was his exploration of Gabriel\u2019s complex sorrows. The novel teems with biblical references. Though the novel is in part about the position of blacks in American society, some critics felt that Baldwin did not adequately address racial issues; the novelist, however, said he made a deliberate attempt to break out of the \u201ccage\u201d of black writing."
