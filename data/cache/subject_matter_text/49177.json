  " Loyal Publication Society , either of two groups, one in New York and one in New England, that during the American Civil War published pamphlets and broadsides supporting the Union and blasting Copperheads, or Southern sympathizers.",
  "In addition to distributing materials \u201cof unquestionable loyalty,\u201d the societies were active in both state and national politics, allied with the Republican Party. Their main purpose, however, was propagandistic, and the larger Loyal Publication Society of New York ultimately published 900,000 copies of 90 pamphlets. The smaller New England Loyal Publication Society, based in Boston, worked with its counterpart in New York in distributing a wide variety of pro-Union tracts."
