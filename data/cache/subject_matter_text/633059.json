  "Jill Jacobs was born in New Jersey but mostly grew up in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia , where her father was vice president of a savings and loan institution . She began working while in high school. Following her graduation in 1969, she briefly attended a community college to study fashion merchandising but soon changed her mind. She married Bill Stevenson in 1970, but the couple separated in 1974 and divorced the following year. During this time she attended the University of Delaware , earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1975.",
  "That year Jill met Joe Biden on a blind date arranged by his brother. At that time Biden was a U.S. senator and a single father of two young boys, having lost his first wife and infant daughter in a car crash three years previously. The couple married on June 17, 1977, and had a child of their own in 1981. In the meantime, Jill worked as an English teacher at St. Mark\u2019s High School in Wilmington , Delaware. She later taught emotionally troubled adolescents at a psychiatric hospital while studying at West Chester State College (now West Chester University of Pennsylvania ), from which she earned a master\u2019s degree in education in 1981. She devoted the next two years to raising her children before returning to her teaching career.",
  "Jill continued teaching while supporting Joe in his first run for president in 1988 . In 1991 she earned a second master\u2019s degree, this one in English, from Villanova University in Pennsylvania. After working at various high schools, she became a professor at Delaware Technical Community College in 1993, where she remained until 2008. In addition, she continued her studies, earning a doctorate in education from the University of Delaware in 2007.",
  "    Joe again ran for president in 2008 but ultimately dropped out. However, Obama later chose him as his running mate, and Jill campaigned for the ticket while continuing to teach. After Joe was sworn in as vice president in 2009, Jill became a professor of English at Northern Virginia Community College in Alexandria . She is believed to be the first vice president\u2019s spouse to maintain a paying job throughout his tenure. In addition to teaching, she worked with the Obama administration in support of community colleges and their mission. She also helped support the families of members of the military, and she wrote a children\u2019s book, Don\u2019t Forget, God Bless Our Troops (2012), about the experiences of a child whose father was deployed. The book was inspired by the deployment of Joe\u2019s son, Beau Biden, who later died from cancer (2015). Jill\u2019s autobiography, Where the Light Enters: Building a Family, Discovering Myself , appeared in 2019.",
  "In 2020 Joe announced his third presidential bid, and, for the first time, Jill took a leave of absence in order to assume a prominent role in the campaign. In April Joe became the presumptive Democratic nominee. At the party\u2019s national convention, which was a virtual event because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jill gave a speech in which she extolled her husband\u2019s character and his ability to help heal a country that was struggling with both the virus and extreme political polarization. After a difficult and contentious campaign, Joe was elected president, defeating Pres. Donald Trump , on November 3. Trump and other Republicans, however, alleged voter fraud, and on January 6, 2021, Trump supporters attacked the Capitol as Congress was in the process of certifying the election results. Amid a massive security presence Joe was sworn in as president on January 20."
