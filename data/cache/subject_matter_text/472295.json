  "   evaporation ,  process by which an element or compound transitions from its liquid state to its gaseous state below the temperature at which it boils ; in particular, the process by which liquid water enters the atmosphere as water vapour in the water cycle .",
  "  Evaporation, mostly from the oceans and from vegetation, replenishes the humidity of the air. It is an important part of the exchange of energy in the Earth-atmosphere system that produces atmospheric motion and therefore weather and climate . This transfer of water between Earth \u2019s surface and the atmosphere occurs when some molecules in a\u00a0water mass\u00a0have attained sufficient kinetic energy to eject themselves from the water surface. The main factors affecting evaporation are\u00a0temperature (specifically, the temperature difference between the evaporating surface and the air), relative humidity , wind speed, and solar radiation . See also  vaporization ; transpiration ."
