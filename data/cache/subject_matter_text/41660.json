  " AA c ct t BB AA  Huygens\u2019 principle , also called Huygens-Fresnel principle , a statement that all points of a wave front of sound in a transmitting medium or of light in a vacuum or transparent medium may be regarded as new sources of wavelets that expand in every direction at a rate depending on their velocities. Proposed by the Dutch mathematician, physicist, and astronomer Christiaan Huygens in 1690, it is a powerful method for studying various optical phenomena.",
  "  A surface tangent to the wavelets constitutes the new wave front and is called the envelope of the wavelets. If a medium is homogeneous and has the same properties throughout (i.e., is isotropic), permitting light or sound to travel with the same speed regardless of its direction of propagation, the three-dimensional envelope of a point source will be spherical; otherwise, as is the case of light with many crystals, the envelope will be ellipsoidal in shape ( see  double refraction ). An extended light source will consist of an infinite number of point sources and may be thought of as generating a plane wave front."
