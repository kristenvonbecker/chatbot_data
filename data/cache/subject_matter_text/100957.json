  " circuit breaker , automatic switch in an electric circuit . Its function is similar to that of a fuse \u2014to open the circuit if abnormal current conditions occur, usually overloads\u2014but it is not destroyed in operation and can be closed again. The simplest circuit breakers are operated by a solenoid that is activated by an excessive increase in current flow. Small circuit breakers are widely used in place of fuses to protect electrical systems in homes."
