  " Plaine Treatise . . . of Cosmographie,  armillary sphere , early astronomical device for representing the great circles of the heavens, including in the most elaborate instruments the horizon, meridian, Equator, tropics, polar circles, and an ecliptic hoop. The sphere is a skeleton celestial globe, with circles divided into degrees for angular measurement. In the 17th and 18th centuries such models\u2014either suspended, rested on a stand, or affixed to a handle\u2014were used to show the difference between the Ptolemaic theory of a central Earth and the Copernican theory of a central Sun.",
  "The earliest known complete armillary sphere with nine circles is believed to have been the mete\u014droskopion of the Alexandrine Greeks ( c.  ad 140), but earlier and simpler types of ring instruments were also in general use. Ptolemy, in the Almagest, enumerates at least three. It is stated that Hipparchus (146\u2013127 bc ) used a sphere of four rings; and in Ptolemy\u2019s instrument, the astrolabon, there were diametrically disposed tubes upon the graduated circles, the instrument being kept vertical by a plumb line.",
  "The Arabs employed similar instruments with diametric sight rules, or alidades, and it is likely that those made and used in the 12th century by Moors in Spain were the prototypes of all later European armillary spheres."
