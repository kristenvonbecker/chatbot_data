  " antiphonal singing , alternate singing by two choirs or singers. Antiphonal singing is of great antiquity and occurs in the folk and liturgical music of many cultures. Descriptions of it occur in the Old Testament. The antiphonal singing of psalms occurred both in ancient Hebrew and early Christian liturgies; alternating choirs would sing\u2014e.g., half lines of psalm verses.",
  "Similar instances of alternating singing occur in the folk music of modern Yemenite Jews, in African and African American folk music, and in eastern European folk music. The principle is also used in large polychoral compositions (for two or more choirs) by such composers as Giovanni Gabrieli and Johann Sebastian Bach. The term  cori spezzati  (\u201csplit choirs\u201d) was used to describe polychoral singing in Venice in the later 16th century. Compare  responsorial singing ."
