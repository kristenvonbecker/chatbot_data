  " 60 Minutes , prime-time American television news show. It debuted in 1968 on CBS and has become one of the most successful programs in broadcast history.",
  "Created by Don Hewitt and grounded in investigative journalism, 60 Minutes is television\u2019s longest continually running prime-time series. The first of the so-called TV newsmagazines, the program has become the industry standard for television journalism and has influenced similar (but less successful) programs on other networks. 60 Minutes placed in Nielsen \u2019s annual top 10 for a record 23 consecutive seasons and has won more Emmy Awards than any other prime-time program.",
  "In each episode 60 Minutes correspondents offer in-depth reporting on a range of issues of national interest, from politics to entertainment. The topics may originate in-house as reporter-driven pieces, or they may involve current events already receiving media attention. The correspondents have earned strong reputations and numerous awards for gaining unique access to sources and interviewees and for delivering compelling information. The program\u2019s best-known reporter, the often tenacious Mike Wallace, worked as a full-time correspondent from 1968 to 2006, and during that time he won 20 Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards . Other correspondents have included Dan Rather , Morley Safer, Lesley Stahl, Ed Bradley , Scott Pelley, Bob Simon, Steve Kroft, Lara Logan, Anderson Cooper , Norah O\u2019Donnell, and Jon Wertheim.",
  "The show typically operates according to a fixed format, usually combining two serious news investigations with a personal profile or human-interest story. From 1979 to 2011 Andy Rooney delivered a light or comedic commentary at the end of most episodes. At different times in the past, the show included a point-counterpoint segment, offering a conservative and a liberal perspective on a topic."
