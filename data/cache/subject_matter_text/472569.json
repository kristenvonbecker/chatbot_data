[
  " identity of indiscernibles , principle enunciated by G.W. Leibniz that denies the possibility of two objects being numerically distinct while sharing all their properties in common. More formally, the principle states that if x is not identical to y , then there is some property P such that P holds of x and does not hold of y , or that P holds of y and does not hold of x . Equivalently, if x and y share all their properties, then x is identical to y . Its converse, the principle of the indiscernibility of identicals (also known as Leibniz\u2019s Law), asserts that if x is identical to y , then every property of x is a property of y , and vice versa. Leibniz used the principle of the identity of indiscernibles in arguments for a variety of metaphysical doctrines, including the impossibility of Newtonian absolute space."
