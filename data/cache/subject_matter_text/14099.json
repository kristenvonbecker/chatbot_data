  " The Beehive , French La Ruche , artists\u2019 settlement on the outskirts of the Montparnasse section of Paris, which in the early 20th century was the centre of much avant-garde activity. The Beehive housed the ramshackle living quarters and studios of many painters and sculptors, among them Marc Chagall , Fernand L\u00e9ger , Robert Delaunay , Chaim Soutine , Jacques Lipchitz , Henri Laurens , Alexander Archipenko , Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, and Andr\u00e9 Lhote . In addition, this bohemian colony attracted the poets Guillaume Apollinaire , Max Jacob , Blaise Cendrars , and Pierre Reverdy . No single style dominated the settlement; rather, experimentation of all kinds was encouraged."
