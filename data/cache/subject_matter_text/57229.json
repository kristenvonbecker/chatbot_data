[
  " optical image , the apparent reproduction of an object, formed by a lens or mirror system from reflected, refracted, or diffracted light waves. There are two kinds of images, real and virtual. In a real image the light rays actually are brought to a focus at the image position, and the real image may be made visible on a screen\u2014 e.g., a sheet of paper\u2014whereas a virtual image cannot. Examples of real images are those made by a camera lens on film or a projection lens on a motion-picture screen. Virtual images are made by rays that do not actually come from where the image seems to be; e.g., the virtual image in a plane mirror is at some distance behind the mirror."
