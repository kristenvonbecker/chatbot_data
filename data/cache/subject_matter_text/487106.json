  " The Waste Land , long poem by T.S. Eliot , published in 1922, first in London in The Criterion (October), next in New York City in The Dial (November), and finally in book form, with footnotes by Eliot. The 433-line, five-part poem was dedicated to fellow poet Ezra Pound , who helped condense the original manuscript to nearly half its size. It was one of the most influential works of the 20th century.",
  " The Waste Land expresses with great power the disillusionment and disgust of the period after World War I. In a series of fragmentary vignettes, loosely linked by the legend of the search for the Grail , it portrays a sterile world of panicky fears and barren lusts and of human beings waiting for some sign or promise of redemption. The depiction of spiritual emptiness in the secularized city\u2014the decay of urbs aeterna (the \u201ceternal city\u201d)\u2014is not a simple contrast of the heroic past with the degraded present; it is rather a timeless, simultaneous awareness of moral grandeur and moral evil.",
  "The poem initially met with controversy as its complex and erudite style was alternately denounced for its obscurity and praised for its Modernism ."
