  " To Build a Fire , short story by Jack London , published in Century Magazine in 1908 and later reprinted in the 1910 collection Lost Face . (An earlier draft had been published in 1902 in Youth\u2019s Companion .) London\u2019s widely anthologized masterpiece illustrates in graphic terms the futility of human efforts to conquer nature. Set in the Klondike in winter, the story concerns a man who ignores warnings and attempts to travel a great distance in the extreme cold. Although even his dog senses the folly of the journey, the man stubbornly continues to believe in his own infallibility. His doom is sealed when, after getting his feet wet, he is unable to build the crucial fire that might save his life. London\u2019s stark, unadorned prose is a powerful vehicle for his grim message."
