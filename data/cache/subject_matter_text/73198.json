  " transformational grammar , also called Transformational-generative Grammar , a system of language analysis that recognizes the relationship among the various elements of a sentence and among the possible sentences of a language and uses processes or rules (some of which are called transformations) to express these relationships. For example, transformational grammar relates the active sentence \u201cJohn read the book\u201d with its corresponding passive, \u201cThe book was read by John.\u201d The statement \u201cGeorge saw Mary\u201d is related to the corresponding questions, \u201cWhom [or who] did George see?\u201d and \u201cWho saw Mary?\u201d Although sets such as these active and passive sentences appear to be very different on the surface ( i.e., in such things as word order), a transformational grammar tries to show that in the \u201cunderlying structure\u201d ( i.e., in their deeper relations to one another), the sentences are very similar. Transformational grammar assigns a \u201cdeep structure\u201d and a \u201csurface structure\u201d to show the relationship of such sentences. Thus, \u201cI know a man who flies planes\u201d can be considered the surface form of a deep structure approximately like \u201cI know a man. The man flies airplanes.\u201d The notion of deep structure can be especially helpful in explaining ambiguous utterances; e.g., \u201cFlying airplanes can be dangerous\u201d may have a deep structure, or meaning, like \u201cAirplanes can be dangerous when they fly\u201d or \u201cTo fly airplanes can be dangerous.\u201d",
  "The most widely discussed theory of transformational grammar was proposed by U.S. linguist Noam Chomsky in 1957. His work contradicted earlier tenets of structuralism by rejecting the notion that every language is unique. The use of transformational grammar in language analysis assumes a certain number of formal and substantive universals."
