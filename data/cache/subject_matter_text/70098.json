  "  sublimation , in physics, conversion of a substance from the solid to the gaseous state without its becoming liquid . An example is the vaporization of frozen carbon dioxide ( dry ice ) at ordinary atmospheric pressure and temperature . The phenomenon is the result of vapour pressure and temperature relationships. Freeze-drying of food to preserve it involves sublimation of water from the food in a frozen state under high vacuum. See also  vaporization ; phase diagram ."
