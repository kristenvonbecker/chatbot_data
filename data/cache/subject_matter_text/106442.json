  " Islamic arts , literary, performing, and visual arts of the vast populations of the Islamic world from the 7th century onward. Adherents of Islam and those living in Islamic settings have created such an immense variety of literatures, performing arts, visual arts, and music that it virtually defies any comprehensive definition. In the narrowest sense, the arts of the Islamic peoples might be said to include only those arising directly from the practice of Islam. More commonly, however, the term is extended to include all of the arts produced by Muslim peoples, whether connected with their religion or not. In this article, the subject includes the arts created in pre-Islamic times by Arabs and other peoples in Asia Minor and North Africa who eventually adopted the Islamic faith. On the other hand, arts produced in cultural areas that were only partially Muslim are discussed primarily in articles on arts of those regions ( see  Central Asian arts ; South Asian arts ; Southeast Asian arts ).",
  "It is difficult to establish a common denominator for all of the artistic expressions of the Islamic peoples. Such a common denominator would have to be meaningful for miniature painting and historiography, for a musical mode and the form of a poem. The relationship between the art of the Islamic peoples and its religious basis is anything but direct.",
  "Like most prophetic religions, Islam is not conducive to fine arts. Representation of living beings is prohibited\u2014not in the Qur\u02be\u0101n but in the prophetic tradition. Thus, the centre of the Islamic artistic tradition lies in calligraphy , a distinguishing feature of this culture, in which the word as the medium of divine revelation plays such an important role. Representational art was found, however, in some early palaces and \u201cat the doors of the bathhouses,\u201d according to later Persian poetry. After the 13th century a highly refined art of miniature developed, primarily in the non-Arab countries; it dwells, however, only rarely upon religious subjects. The typical expression of Muslim art is the arabesque , both in its geometric and in its organic form\u2014one leaf, one flower growing out of the other, without beginning and end and capable of almost innumerable variations, only gradually detected by the eye, which never lose their charm. An aversion to empty spaces distinguishes that art; neither the tile-covered walls of a mosque nor the rich imagery of a poem allows an unembellished area, and the decoration of a carpet can be extended almost without limit.",
  " minbar  The centre of Islamic religion is the clean place for prayer, enlarged into the mosque, which comprises the community and all its needs. The essential structure is similar throughout the Muslim world. There are, of course, period and regional differences\u2014large, wide court mosques of early times; the court mosques with big halls of Iran and adjacent countries; central buildings with the wonderfully shaped domes of the Ottoman Empire . The implements, however, are the same: a niche called a mihrab\u2014pointing to Mecca \u2014made of wood, marble, mosaic, stone, tiles; a small pulpit (  minbar  ) for the Friday sermon; minarets, locally differently shaped but always rising like the call to prayer that is uttered from their tops; the wooden carved stands for the Qur\u02be\u0101n, which is to be written in the most perfect form; sometimes highly artistic lamps (made in Syria and proverbially mentioned throughout the Muslim world); perhaps bronze candlesticks, with inlaid ornaments; and rich variations of the prayer mats. If any decoration was needed, it was the words of God, beautifully written or carved in the walls or around the domes. At first connected with the mosques and later independent of them are schools, mausoleums, rooms for the students, and cells for the religious masters.",
  "The poetry of the Arabs consisted in the beginning of praise and satirical poems thought to be full of magical qualities. The strict rules of the outward form of the poems ( monorhyme , complicated metre) even in pre-Islamic times led to a certain formalism and encouraged imitation. Another early poetic form was the elegy, as noted in the work of the Arab female poet al-Khans\u0101\u02be (died after 630).",
  "For the most part, however, Goethe\u2019s statement that the stories of The Thousand and One Nights have no goal in themselves shows his understanding of the character of Arabic belles lettres, contrasting them with the Islamic religion, which aims at \u201ccollecting and uniting people in order to achieve one high goal.\u201d Poets, on the other hand, rove around without any ethical purpose, according to the Qur\u02be\u0101n. For many pious Muslims, poetry was something suspect, opposed to the divine law, especially since it sang mostly of forbidden wine and of free love. The combination of music and poetry, as practiced in court circles and among the mystics, has always aroused the wrath of the lawyer divines who wield so much authority in Islamic communities. This opposition may partly explain why Islamic poetry and fine arts took refuge in a kind of unreal world, using fixed images that could be correctly interpreted only by those who were knowledgeable in the art.",
  "The ambiguity of Persian poetry, which oscillates between the worldly, the divine, and often the political level, is typical of Islamic writings. Especially in Iran and the countries under its cultural influence, this kind of poetry formed the most important part of literature. Epic poetry of all kinds developed exclusively outside the Arabic-speaking countries; Western readers look in vain for an epical structure in such long poems (as in the case of the prose-romances of the Arabs) and find instead a rather aimless representation of facts and fictions. A similar characteristic even conditions innumerable historical works in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, which, especially in classical times, contain much valuable information, put together without being shaped into a real work of art; only rarely does the historian or philosopher reach a comprehensive view. The first attempt at a philosophy of history, Ibn Khald\u016bn \u2019s Muqaddimah , in the 14th century, was rarely studied by his Arab compatriots.",
  "The accumulation of large amounts of material, which is carefully organized up to the present, seems typical of all branches of Islamic scholarship, from theology to natural sciences. There are many minute observations and descriptions but rarely a full view of the whole process. Later, especially in the Persian, Turkish, and Indo-Muslim areas, a tendency to overstress the decorative elements of prose is evident, and the contents even of official chronicles are hidden behind a network of rhymed prose, which is often difficult to disentangle.",
  " The Building of the Famous Castle of Khawarnaq The Building of the Famous Castle of Khawarnaq Khamseh  This tendency is illustrated in all branches of Islamic art: the lack of \u201carchitectural\u201d formation. Instead, there is a kind of carpetlike pattern; the Arabic and Persian poem is, in general, judged not as a closed unity but rather according to the perfection of its individual verses. Its main object is not to convey a deep personal feeling but to perfect to the utmost the traditional rules and inherited metaphors, to which a new image may sometimes be added. Thus, the personality of the poet becomes visible only through the minimal changes of expression and rhythm and the application of certain preferred metaphors, just as the personality of the miniature painter can be detected by a careful observation of details, of his way of colouring a rock or deepening the shade of a turban. The same holds true for the arabesques, which were developed according to a strict ritual to a mathematical pattern and were refined until they reached a perfection of geometrically complicated figures, as in the dome of the Karatay Medrese in Konya (1251); it corresponds both to the most intricate lacelike K\u016bfic inscriptions around this dome and to the poetical style of Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b , who wrote in that very place and during those years. His immortal mystical poems comprise thousands of variations on the central theme of love. Although such a perfect congruency of poetry and fine arts is not frequently found, the precept about Persian art that \u201cits wings are too heavy with beauty\u201d can also be applied to Persian poetry. Thus, the tile work of a Persian mosque, which combines different levels of arabesque work with different styles of writing, is reminiscent of the way Persian poetry combines at least two levels of reality. And a perfect harmony is reached in some of the miniature manuscripts of Iran, Muslim India, or Ottoman Turkey, which, in their lucid colours and fine details of execution, recall both the perfection of the calligraphy that surrounds them on delicate paper and the subtlety of the stories or poems that they accompany or illustrate.",
  "Those accustomed to the Western ideals of plasticity or form in the fine arts and literature or to the polyphonic interweaving of melodic lines in music have some difficulties in appreciating this art. The palaces seem to be without a fixed architectural plan; rooms and gardens are simply laid out according to daily needs. The historian offers an astounding amount of detailed reports and facts but with no unifying concept. The Muslim writer prefers this carpetlike form and adds colour to colour, motif to motif, so that the reader only understands the meaning and end of the whole web from a certain distance. Music, differentiated as it may be in the countries between Morocco and India, follows the same model: variations of highest subtlety on a comparatively simple given subject or theme.",
  "Drama and opera in the Western sense did not develop in the Islamic countries until the 19th century, and the art of the novel is also a comparatively recent development. There was no reason for drama: in the Muslim perception, God is the only actor who can do whatever he pleases, whose will is inscrutable. Humans are, at best, puppets on a string, behind whose movements those with insight detect the hand of the play master. Neither is the problem of personal guilt and absolution posed as it is in the West, nor is a catharsis , or purging of emotion, needed through drama. The atomist theory, widely accepted in Islam since the 10th century, leaves no room for a \u201cdramatic\u201d movement; it teaches that God creates everything anew in every moment, and what is called a \u201claw of nature\u201d is nothing but God\u2019s custom, which he can interrupt whenever he pleases.",
  "It is true that certain other forms are found in the more folkloristic arts of Islam. Every region has produced poetry, in regional languages, that is livelier and more realistic than the classical court poetry, but poetry limited to one region tends to become restricted to certain fixed forms that can be easily imitated. Attempts at drama in Islam come from these more popular spheres in Iran (and, rarely, in Lebanon and Iraq), where the tragic events of the murder of \u1e24usayn (680) at Karbala were dramatized in strange forms, using the vocabulary of traditional Persian poetry and theology. Thus, strangely hybrid forms emerge in the Islamic arts, highly interesting for the historian of religion and the student of literature but not typical of the classic Islamic ideals. Popular illustrations of tales and legends and those of some of the heroes of the Shi\u02bfah are similarly interesting but atypical. In modern times, of course, there have been imitations of all forms of Western literary and visual arts: paintings in the Impressionist or Cubist style; the use of free verse instead of the stern classical forms; and novels, dramas, motion pictures, and music combining Western and Eastern modes. Belief in the Qur\u02be\u0101nic dictum \u201cWhatever is on earth will perish save His face\u201d discouraged artistic endeavour on a large scale, but the Prophetic tradition ( Hadith ) \u201cVerily God is beautiful and loves beauty\u201d has inspired numberless artists and artisans, writers and poets, musicians, and mystics to develop their arts and crafts as a reflection of that divine beauty. A theory of aesthetics comprising the various artistic expressions of the Muslim peoples has yet to be written. Although there have been a number of studies in literary criticism, the formal indebtedness of some of the best modern poets and painters to the Islamic heritage has yet to be fully articulated.",
  "It is notable that the arts of the Islamic peoples have had relatively little impact on other cultures, certainly far less than their artistic merit would appear to warrant. Europe has known art objects of Islamic origin since the early Middle Ages, when they were brought home by the Crusaders or manufactured by the Arabs in Sicily and Spain. Much admired and even imitated, they formed part of the material culture in those times, so much so that even the coronation robes of the German emperor were decorated with an Arabic inscription. At the same time, Islamic motives wandered into the belles lettres of Europe, and Islamic scientific books formed a basis for the development of Western science. Islamic culture as such, however, was rather an object of hatred than of admiration; a more objective appreciation of both the works of art and of literature did not start until the mid-17th century, when travelers told of the magnificent buildings in Iran and Mughal India and the first works from Persian literature were translated, influencing German classical literature. Indian miniatures inspired Rembrandt , just as European paintings were imitated by Islamic, especially Mughal , artists. Persian carpets were among the most-coveted gifts for princes and princesses.",
  "A bias against the cultures of the East persisted, however, until after the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment . The indefatigable work of the British scholars at Fort William at Calcutta (now Kolkata ) brought new literary treasures to Europe, where they were studied carefully by specialists in the emerging field of Islamic studies. Poets such as Goethe in Germany in the early 19th century paved the way for a deeper understanding of Islamic poetry. Islamic literatures, however, continue to be known to the larger Western public almost exclusively by  The Thousand and One Nights  (translated first in the early 18th century), Omar Khayyam \u2019s  rob\u0101\u02bfiyy\u0101t  (\u201cquatrains\u201d), and the lyrics of \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93 . Even experts who were aware of the immense wealth of the literatures in the different Islamic languages (such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu) until the 20th century rarely appreciated the literatures from an aesthetic viewpoint; rather, they used them as a source for lexicography and for philological and historical research. The situation in Islamic fine arts and architecture was similar. Although the beauty of the Alhambra , for example, had already inspired European scholars and artists in the early 19th century, a thorough study of Islamic art as an independent field began only in the 20th century. Interest in the music of Islamic peoples, the arabesque-like uniformity of which seems strange to Western ideals of harmony, was also slow to develop.",
  "It would be almost impossible to make an exhaustive survey of Islamic literatures. There are so many works, of which hundreds of thousands are available only in manuscript, that even a very large team of scholars could scarcely master a single branch of the subject. Islamic literatures, moreover, exist over a vast geographical and linguistic area, for they were produced wherever the Muslims went, pushing out from their heartland in Arabia through the countries of the Middle East as far as Spain, North Africa, and, eventually, West Africa. Iran (Persia) is a major centre of Islam , along with the neighbouring areas that came under Persian influence, including Turkey and the Turkic-speaking peoples of Central Asia. Many Indian vernaculars contain almost exclusively Islamic literary subjects. There is an Islamic content in the literature of Malaysia and in that of some East African languages, including Swahili . In many cases, however, the Islamic content proper is restricted to religious works\u2014mystical treatises, books on Islamic law and its implementation, historical works praising the heroic deeds and miraculous adventures of earlier Muslim rulers and saints, or devotional works in honour of the Prophet Muhammad .",
  "The vast majority of Arabic writings are scholarly; the same, indeed, is true of the other languages under discussion. There are superb historically important translations made by medieval scholars from Greek into Arabic; historical works, both general and particular; a range of religiously inspired works; books on grammar and on stylistics, on ethics and on philosophy. All have helped to shape the spirit of Islamic literature in general, and it is often difficult to draw a line between such works of \u201cscholarship\u201d and works of \u201cliterature\u201d in the narrower sense of that term. Even a strictly theological commentary can bring about a deeper understanding of some problem of aesthetics . A work of history composed in florid and \u201cartistic\u201d language would certainly be regarded by its author as a work of art as well as of scholarship, whereas the grammarian would be equally sure that his keen insights into the structure of Arabic grammar were of the utmost importance in preserving that literary beauty in which Arabs and non-Arabs alike took pride.",
  "In this treatment of Islamic literatures, however, the definition of \u201cliterature\u201d is restricted to poetry and belles lettres , whether popular or courtly in inspiration. Other categories of writing will be dealt with briefly if these shed light on some particular aspect of literature.",
  "Although Islamic literatures appear in such a wide range of languages and in so many different cultural environments, their unity",
  "is safeguarded by the identity of the basic existential experience, by the identity of the fundamental intellectual interests, by the authoritativeness of certain principles of form and presentation, not to mention the kindred political and social organization within which those peoples aspire to live.",
  "The area of Islamic culture extends from western Africa to Malaysia , Indonesia , and the Philippines , but its heartland is Arabia , and the prime importance and special authority of the Arabic language were to remain largely unquestioned after the spread of Islam. The Arabic poetry of pre-Islamic Arabia was regarded for centuries afterward as the standard model for all Islamic poetic achievement, and it directly influenced literary forms in many non-Arab literatures. The Qur\u02be\u0101n , Islam\u2019s sacred scripture, was accepted by pious Muslims as God\u2019s uncreated word and was considered to be the highest manifestation of literary beauty. A whole literature defended its inimitability ( i\u02bfj\u0101z ) and unsurpassable beauty. Because it was God\u2019s own word, the Qur\u02be\u0101n could not legitimately be translated into any other language; the study of at least some Arabic was therefore required of every Muslim. Arabic script was used by all those peoples who followed Islam, however much their own languages might differ in structure from Arabic. The Qur\u02be\u0101n became the textbook of the Muslims\u2019 entire philosophy of life; theology, lexicography, geography, historiography, and mysticism all grew out of a deep study of its form and content; and in even the most secular works there can be found allusions to the holy book. Its imagery not unexpectedly permeates all Islamic poetry and prose.",
  "Between the coming of Islam in the 7th century and the 11th, a great deal of poetry and prose in Arabic was produced. One branch of literature in Spain and North Africa matured in perfect harmony with the classical ideals of the Muslim East, although its masters, during the 11th and 12th centuries, invented a few strophic forms unknown to Classical Arabic poetry. In modern times North African Muslim literature\u2014mainly from Algeria and Morocco \u2014often uses French as a means of expression, because the tradition of Arabic writing was interrupted by the French occupation in the 19th century and has had to be built up afresh.",
  "In 640 the Muslims entered Iran , and Persian influence on literary taste is apparent in Arabic literature from the mid-8th century onward. Many stories and tales were transmitted from, or through, Iran to the Arab world and often from there to western Europe. Soon Iran could boast a large literature in its own tongue. Persian literature was more varied in its forms and content than that written in Classical Arabic. Although Persian adopted many of the formal rules of the Arabic language (including prosody and rhyme patterns), new genres, including epic poetry, were introduced from Iran. The lyric, elegant and supple, also reached its finest expression in the Persian language .",
  "Persian culture was by no means restricted to Iran itself. Northwestern India and what is now Pakistan became a centre of Islamic literature as early as the 11th century, with Delhi and Agra being of special importance. It was to remain a stronghold of Muslim cultural life, which soon also extended to the east ( Bengal ) and south ( Deccan ). Persian remained the official language of Muslim India until 1835, and not only its poetry but even its historiography was written in the high-flown manner that exemplified the Persian concept of fine style. Muslim India can further boast a fine heritage of Arabic poetry and prose (theological, philosophical, and mystical works).",
  "At various times in its history the Indian subcontinent was ruled by princes of Turkic origin (indeed, the words \u201cTurk\u201d and \u201cMuslim\u201d became synonymous in some Indian languages). The princes surrounded themselves with a military aristocracy of mainly Turkic extraction, and a few poetical and prose works in Turkic languages were thus written at some Indian courts. In various regions of the subcontinent an extremely pleasing folk literature has flourished throughout the ages: Sindhi in the lower Indus Valley , for example, and Punjabi in the Punjab are languages rich in an emotional poetry that uses popular metres and forms. At the Indo-Iranian border the oldest fragments of the powerful Pashto poetry date from the Middle Ages. The neighbouring Balochi poetry consists largely of ballads and religious folk songs. All the peoples in this area have interpreted Islamic mysticism in their own simple, touching imagery. In the east of the subcontinent Bengali Muslims possess a large Islamic literary heritage , including religious epics from the 14th and 15th centuries and some lovely religious folk songs. The achievements of modern novelists and lyric poets from Bangladesh are impressive. As a result of the spread of Islam to the north in the 14th century, a number of classical themes in Islamic lore were elaborated in Kashmiri lyric and epic poetry. To the south an occasional piece of Islamic religious poetry can be found even in Tamil and Malayalam . Some fine Muslim short stories have been produced in modern Malayalam.",
  " Urdu , now the chief literary language of Muslim India and Pakistan, borrowed heavily from Persian literature during its classical period in the 18th century. In many writings only the verbs are in Urdu, the rest consisting of Persian constructions and vocabulary, and the themes of traditional Urdu literature were often adapted from Persian. Modern Urdu prose, however, has freed itself almost completely from the past, whereas in poetry promising steps have been taken toward modernization of both forms and content ( see South Asian arts: Islamic literatures and Modern period ).",
  "An elaborate \u201cclassical\u201d style developed in Turkish after the 14th century, reaching its peak in the 17th. Like classical Urdu, it was heavily influenced by Persian in metrics and vocabulary. Many exponents of this \u201chigh\u201d style came from the Balkan provinces of the Ottoman Empire . On the other hand, a rich and moving folk poetry in popular syllable-counting metres has always flourished among the Turkish population of Anatolia and Rumelia . The mystical songs of the poet Yunus Emre (died c. 1320) contributed greatly toward shaping this body of literature, which was preserved in the religious centres of the Sufi orders of Islam. From this folk tradition, as well as from Western literature, modern Turkish literature has derived a great deal of its inspiration.",
  "A great deal of the Muslim literature of Central Asia is written in Turkic languages, which include Uzbek , Tatar , and Kyrgyz . Its main cultural centres ( Samarkand , Bukhara , Fergana ) became part of the Muslim empire after 711. Central Asia was an important centre of Islamic learning until the tsarist invasions in the 1870s, and the peoples of this region have produced a classical literature in Arabic. Many of the most famous Arabic and Persian scholars and poets writing in the heyday of Muslim influence were Central Asians by birth. Central Asians also possess a considerable literature of their own, consisting in large part of epics, folktales, and mystical \u201cwords of wisdom.\u201d The rules of prosody that hold for Arabic and Persian languages have been deliberately imposed on the Turkic languages on several occasions, notably by \u02bfAl\u012b Sh\u012br Nav\u0101\u02be\u012b (died 1501), a master of Chagatai poetry and prose in Her\u0101t, and by B\u0101bur (died 1530), the first Mughal emperor in India. Tajik literature is basically Persian, both as it is written today in Tajikistan and as it existed in earlier forms, when it was indistinguishable from classical Persian. After the Russification of the country, and especially after the 1917 Revolution , a new literature emerged that was part and parcel of the former Soviet literature . The same can be said, by and large, about the literatures of other Muslim Turkic peoples of Central Asia.",
  "Smaller fragments of Islamic literature, in Chinese, are found in China (which has quite a large Muslim population) and in the Philippines . The literary traditions of Indonesia and of Malaysia, where the religion of Islam arrived long ago, are also worth noting. Historical and semimythical tales about Islamic heroes are a feature of the literature in these areas, a fact of immense interest to folklorists.",
  "Contact with Islam and its \u201cwritten\u201d culture also helped to preserve national idioms in many regions. Often such idioms were enriched by Arabic vocabulary and Islamic concepts. The leaders of the Muslims in such areas in northern Nigeria , for example, preferred to write poetry and chronicles in Arabic while using their mother tongue for more popular forms of literature ( see  African literature: Literatures in African languages ). Of particular interest in this connection is Kurdish literature, which has preserved in an Iranian language several important, popular heterodox texts and epics.",
  "Small fragments of Arabic literature have long been known in the West. There were cultural interrelations between Muslim Spain (which, like the Indus Valley, became part of the Muslim empire after 711) and its Christian neighbours, and this meant that many philosophical and scientific works filtered through to western Europe. It is also likely that the poetry of Muslim Spain influenced the growth of certain forms of Spanish and French troubadour poetry and provided an element, however distorted, for medieval Western romances and heroic tales.",
  "Investigation of Eastern literatures by Western scholars did not begin until the 16th century in the Netherlands and England. First attempts toward an aesthetic understanding of Arabic and Persian poetry came even later: they were made by the British scholars of Fort William, Calcutta (now Kolkata), and by German pre-Romantics of the late 18th century. In the first half of the 19th century the publication of numerous translations of Eastern poetry, especially into German, began to interest some Europeans. The poetical translations from Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit made by the German poet Friedrich R\u00fcckert can scarcely be surpassed, either in accuracy or in poetical mastery. The Persian poet \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93 became well known in German-speaking countries, thanks to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s enchanting West-\u00f6stlicher Divan (1819; \u201cThe Parliament of East and West\u201d; Eng. trans. Poems of the East and West ), a collection of self-consciously Persian-style poetry, which represented the first Western response to and appreciation of the character of Middle Eastern poetry by an acknowledged giant of European literature. An \u201cOrientalizing style,\u201d which employed Arabo-Persian literary forms such as the ghazal (a short graceful poem with monorhyme), became fashionable at times in Germany. Later, Edward FitzGerald aroused new interest in Persian poetry with his free adaptations of Omar Khayyam \u2019s rob\u0101\u02bfiyy\u0101t ( The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m , 1859). The fairy tales known as The Thousand and One Nights , first translated in 1704, provided abundant raw material for many a Western writer\u2019s play, novel, story, or poem about the Islamic East.",
  "In order to understand and enjoy Eastern literature, one must study its external characteristics most carefully. The literatures of the Islamic peoples are \u201cintellectual\u201d; in neither poetry nor prose are there many examples of subjective lyricism as it is understood in the West. The principal genres, forms, and rules were inherited from pre-Islamic Arabic poetry but were substantially elaborated afterward, especially by the Persians.",
  "Arabic poetry is built upon the principle of monorhyme, and the single rhyme, usually consisting in one letter, is employed throughout every poem, long or short. The structure of the Arabic language permits such monorhymes to be achieved with comparative ease. The Persians and their imitators often extended the rhyming part over two or more syllables ( rad\u012bf ) or groups of words, which are repeated after the dominant rhyming consonant. The metres are quantitative, counting long and short syllables ( \u02bfar\u016b\u1e0d ). Classical Arabic has 16 basic metres in five groupings; they can undergo certain variations, but the poet is not allowed to change the metre in the course of the poem. Syllable-counting metres, as well as strophic forms, are used in popular, or \u201clow,\u201d poetry; only in post-Classical Arabic were some strophic forms introduced into \u201chigh\u201d poetry. Many modern Islamic poets, from Pakistan to Turkey and North Africa, have discarded the classical system of prosody altogether. In part they have substituted verse forms imitating Western models such as strophic poems with or without rhyme; since about 1950 free verse has almost become the rule, although a certain tendency toward rhyming or to the use of alliterative quasi-rhymes can be observed.",
  "The chief poetic genres, as they emerged according to traditional rules, are the qa\u1e63\u012bdah , the ghazal , and the qi\u1e6d\u02bfah ; in Iran and its adjacent countries there are, further, the rob\u0101\u02bf\u012b and the mas\u0304nav\u012b .",
  "The qa\u1e63\u012bdah (literally \u201cpurpose poem\u201d), a genre whose form was invented by pre-Islamic Arabs, has from 20 to more than 100 verses and usually contains an account of the poet\u2019s journey. In the classic pattern, the parts followed a fixed sequence, beginning with a love-poem prologue ( nas\u012bb ), followed by a description of the journey itself, and finally reaching its real goal by flattering the poet\u2019s patron, sharply attacking some adversaries of his tribe, or else indulging in measureless self-praise. Everywhere in the Muslim world the qa\u1e63\u012bdah became the characteristic form for panegyric . It could serve for religious purposes as well: solemn praise of God, eulogies of the Prophet, and songs of praise and lament for the martyr-heroes of Shi\u02bfi Islam were all expressed in this form. Later the introductory part of the qa\u1e63\u012bdah often was taken up by a description of nature or given over to some words of wisdom, or the poet took the opportunity to demonstrate his skill in handling extravagant language and to show off his learning. Such exhibitions were made all the more difficult because, though it varied according to the rank of the person to whom it was addressed, the vocabulary of each type of qa\u1e63\u012bdah was controlled by rigid conventions. This type of poetry, however, could obviously lend itself easily to empty verbosity or to pedantry.",
  "The ghazal possibly originated as an independent elaboration of the qa\u1e63\u012bdah \u2019s introductory section, and it usually embodies a love poem. Ideally, its length varies between 5 and 12 verses. It can be used for either religious or secular expression, the two often being blended indistinguishably. Its diction is light and graceful, its effect comparable to that of chamber music, whereas the qa\u1e63\u012bdah writer employs, so to speak, the full orchestral resources.",
  "Monorhyme is used in both the qa\u1e63\u012bdah and ghazal . But while these two forms begin with two rhyming hemistiches (half lines of a verse), in the qi\u1e6d\u02bfah (\u201csection\u201d) the first hemistich does not rhyme, and the effect is as though the poem had been \u201ccut out\u201d of a longer one (hence its name). The qi\u1e6d\u02bfah is a less-serious literary form that was used to deal with aspects of everyday life; it served mainly for occasional poems, satire, jokes, word games, and chronograms.",
  "The form of the rob\u0101\u02bf\u012b , which is a quatrain in fixed metre with a rhyme scheme of a a b a , seems to go back to pre-Islamic Persian poetical tradition. It has supplied the Persian poets with a flexible vehicle for ingenious aphorisms and similarly concise expressions of thought for religious, erotic, or skeptical purposes. The peoples who came under Persian cultural influence happily adopted this form.",
  "Epic poetry was unknown to the Arabs, who were averse to fiction, whether it was expressed in poetry or in prose. The development of epic poetry was thus hindered, just as was the creation of novels or short stories. Nevertheless, mas\u0304nav\u012b \u2014which means literally \u201cthe doubled one,\u201d or rhyming couplet, and by extension a poem consisting of a series of such couplets\u2014became a favourite poetical form of the Persians and those cultures they influenced. The mas\u0304nav\u012b enabled the poet to develop the thread of a tale through thousands of verses. Yet even in such poetry only a restricted number of metres were employed, and no metre allowed more than 11 syllables in a hemistich. Metre and diction were prescribed in accordance with the topic; a didactic mas\u0304nav\u012b required a style and metre different from a heroic or romantic one. The mas\u0304nav\u012b usually begins with a praise of God, and this strikes the keynote of the poem.",
  "There are a variety of other forms that are more or less restricted to folk poetry, such as the s\u012b\u1e25arf\u012b (\u201cgolden alphabet\u201d), in which each line or each stanza begins with succeeding letters of the Arabic alphabet. In Muslim India the barahmasa (\u201c12 months\u201d) is a sort of lovers\u2019 calendar in which the poet, assuming the role of a young woman of longing, expresses the lover\u2019s feelings in accord with the seasons of the year. Apart from these, later writers tried to develop strophic forms. Sometimes ghazal s with the same metre were bound together as \u201cstanzas\u201d to form a longer unit through the use of a linking verse. When the linking verse was recurrent, the poem was called a tarj\u012b\u02bf-band (literally \u201creturn-tie\u201d); when the linking verse was varied, the poem was called a tark\u012bb-band (literally \u201ccomposite-tie\u201d). True stanzas of varying lengths were also invented. Among these, mainly in Urdu and Chagatai, a six-line stanza known as musaddas became the form used for the mars\u0304\u012byeh (dirge for the martyrs of Karbala ). Because it had come to be associated with lofty feeling and serious thought, musaddas later was used for the first reformist modern poems.",
  "The Arabs inherited a love for rhymed prose from pre-Islamic Arabia. Although the extent of prose literature, even in the field of belles lettres, is very large, the novel and novella were introduced only after contact with European literatures .",
  "The most typical expression of the Arabic\u2014and Islamic\u2014spirit in prose is the maq\u0101mah (meaning \u201cgathering,\u201d \u201cassembly\u201d), which tells basically simple stories in an extremely and marvelously complicated style (abounding in word plays, logographs, double entendres, and the like) and which comes closest to the Western concept of the short story .",
  "The versatility and erudition of the classical maq\u0101mah authors is dazzling, but the fables and parables that, during the first centuries of Islam, had been told in a comparatively easy flowing style later became subject to a growing trend toward artificiality, as did almost every other literary genre, including expository prose. Persian historiographers and Turkic-language biographers, Indo-Muslim writers on mysticism, and even writers on science all indulged in a style in which rhyme and rhetoric often completely obscured the meaning. It is only since the late 19th century that a matter-of-fact style has slowly become acceptable in literary circles; the influence of translations from European languages, the role of journalism , and the growing pride in a pure language freed from the cobwebs of the past worked together to make Islamic languages more pliable and less artificial.",
  "In all forms of poetry and in most types of prose, writers shared a common fund of imagery that was gradually refined and enlarged in the course of time. The main source of imagery was the Qur\u02be\u0101n , its figures and utterances often divested of their sacred significance. Thus, the beautiful Joseph (surah 12) is a fitting symbol for the handsome beloved; the nightingale may sing the psalms of David (surah 21:79 et al.); and the rose sits on Solomon \u2019s wind-borne throne (surah 21:81 et al.), and its opening petals can be compared to Joseph\u2019s shirt rent by Potiphar\u2019s wife (surah 12:25 ff.) and its scent to that of Joseph\u2019s shirt, which cured blind Jacob (surah 12:94). The tulip reminds the poet of the burning bush before which Moses stood (surah 20:9 ff.), and the coy beloved refuses the lover\u2019s demands by answering, like God to Moses, \u201cThou shalt not see me\u201d (surah 7:143), but her (or his) kiss gives the dying lover new life, like the breath of Jesus (surah 3:49).",
  "Classical Persian poetry often mentions knights and kings from Iran\u2019s history alongside those from Arabic heroic tales. The cup of wine offered by the \u201cold man of the Magians\u201d is comparable to the miraculous cup owned by the Iranian mythical king Jamsh\u012bd or to Alexander\u2019s mirror, which showed the marvels of the world; the nightingale may sing \u201cZoroastrian tunes\u201d when it contemplates the \u201cfire temple of the rose.\u201d Central scenes from the great Persian mas\u0304nav\u012b s contributed to the imagery of later writers in Persian-, Turkic-, and Urdu-speaking areas. Social and political conditions are reflected in a favourite literary equation between the \u201cbeautiful and cruel beloved\u201d and \u201cthe Turk\u201d: because in Iran and India the military caste was usually of Turkic origin, and because the Turk was always considered \u201cwhite\u201d and handsome, in literary imagery he stood as the \u201cruler of hearts.\u201d Minute arabesque-like descriptions of nature, particularly of garden scenes, are frequent: the rose and the nightingale have almost become substitutes for mythological figures.",
  "The versatile writer was expected to introduce elegant allusions to Classical Arabic and Persian literature and to folklore and to know enough about astrology, alchemy, and medicine to use the relevant technical terms accurately. Images inspired by the pastimes of the grandees\u2014chess, polo, hunting, and the like\u2014were as necessary for a good poem as were those referring to music, painting, and calligraphy. Similarly, allusions in poetic imagery to the Arabic alphabet \u2014often thought to be endowed with mystical significance or magical properties\u2014were very common in all Islamic literatures.",
  "The poet had to follow strict rules laid down by the masters of rhetoric, rigidly observing the harmonious selection of similes thought proper to any one given sphere (four allusions to Qur\u02be\u0101nic figures, for example, or three garden images all given in a single verse). The poet was expected to invent new fantastic etiologies ( \u1e25osn-e ta\u02bfl\u012bl ): he had to describe natural phenomena in some elegant and surprising metaphor. Thus, \u201cThe narcissus has strewn silver in the way of the bride rose\u201d means simply \u201cThe narcissus has withered\u201d\u2014for when the rose (dressed in red, like an Eastern bride) appears in late spring, it is time for the narcissus to shed its white petals, just as people would shed silver coins in the way of a bridal procession.",
  "The writer was also expected to use puns and to play with words of two or more meanings. He might write verses that could provide an intelligible meaning even when read backward. He had to be able to handle chronograms, codes based on the numerical values of a phrase or verse, which, when understood, gave the date of some relevant event. Later writers sometimes supplied the date of a book\u2019s compilation by hiding a chronogram in its title. A favourite device in poetry was the question-and-answer form, employed in the whole poem or only in chosen sections.",
  "Writers were expected to demonstrate talent at both improvisation and elaboration on any theme if they wished to attract the interest of a generous patron. Poetry was judged according to the perfection of its individual verses. Only in rare cases was the poem appreciated as a whole: the lack of coherent argument, which often puzzles the Western reader in ghazal poetry, is in fact deliberate.",
  "It would be idle to look for the sincere expression of personal emotion in Arabic, Turkish, or Persian poetry. The conventions are so rigid that the reader is allowed only a rare glimpse into the poet\u2019s feelings. Indeed, such feelings were put through the sieve of intellect, and personal experiences were thereby transformed into arabesque-like work of artistry, if not art. In the hands of mediocre versifiers and prose writers, however, literature became mannered and completely artificial. The reader soon tires of the constantly recurring moon faces, hyacinth curls, ruby lips, and cypress statures (that is, tall and slender). Yet the great masters of poetry and rhetoric (who all have their favourite imagery, rhymes, and rhythmical patterns) will sometimes allow the patient reader a glimpse into their hearts by a slight rhythmical change or by a new way of expressing a conventional thought.",
  "These are, of course, quite crude generalizations. Folk poetry, for instance, has to be judged by different standards, though even here conventional forms and inherited imagery make it, on the whole, more standardized than might be wished. Only in the 20th century was a complete break with classical ideals made. Since then, sincerity instead of monotonous imitation, political and social commitment instead of empty panegyric, and realism instead of escapism have been the characteristic features of modern literatures of the Muslim countries.",
  "The first known poetic compositions of the Arabs are of such perfect beauty and, at the same time, are so conventionalized that they raise the question as to how far back an actual poetic tradition does stretch. A great number of pre-Islamic poems, dating from the mid-6th century, were preserved by oral tradition. The seven most famous pieces are  al-Mu\u02bfallaq\u0101t  (\u201cThe Suspended Ones,\u201d known as The Seven Odes ), and these are discussed more fully below. The term mu\u02bfallaq\u0101t is not fully understood; later legend asserts that the seven poems had been hung in the most important Arab religious sanctuary, the Ka\u02bfbah in Mecca, because of their eloquence and beauty and had brought victory to their authors in the poetical contests traditionally held during the season of pilgrimage. Apart from these seven, quite a number of shorter poems were preserved by later scholars. An independent genre in pre-Islamic poetry was the elegy, often composed by a woman, usually a deceased hero\u2019s sister. Some of these poems, especially those by the poet al-Khans\u0101\u02be (died after 630) are notable for their compact expressiveness.",
  "The poet (called a sh\u0101\u02bfir , a wizard endowed with magic powers) was thought to be inspired by a spirit ( jinn , shay\u1e6d\u0101n ). The poet defended the honour of his tribe and perpetuated their deeds. Religious expression was rare in pre-Islamic poetry. In the main it reflects the sense of fatalism that was probably needed if the harsh circumstances of Bedouin life in the desert were to be endured.",
  "The most striking feature of pre-Islamic poetry is the uniformity and refinement of its language. Although the various tribes, constantly feuding with one another, all spoke their own dialects, they shared a common language for poetry whether they were Bedouins or inhabitants of the small capitals of al-\u1e24\u012brah and Ghass\u0101n (where the influence of Aramaic culture was also in evidence).",
  "Arabic was even then a virile and expressive language, with dozens of synonyms for the horse, the camel, the lion, and so forth; and it possessed a rich stock of descriptive adjectives. Because of those features, it is difficult for foreigners and modern Arabs alike to appreciate fully the artistic qualities of early Arabic poetry. Imagery is precise, and descriptions of natural phenomena are detailed. The sense of universal applicability is lacking, however, and the comparatively simple literary techniques of simile and metaphor predominate. The imaginative power that was later to be the hallmark of Arabic poetry under Persian influence had not yet become evident.",
  "The strikingly rich vocabulary of Classical Arabic, as well as its sophisticated structure, is matched by highly elaborate metrical schemes, based on quantity. The rhythmical structures were analyzed by the grammarian Khal\u012bl of Basra (died c. 791), who distinguished 16 metres. Each was capable of variation by shortening the foot or part of it, but the basic structure was rigidly preserved. One and the same rhyme letter had to be maintained throughout the poem. (The rules of rhyming are detailed and very complicated but were followed quite strictly from the 6th to the early 20th century.)",
  "As well as rules governing the outward form of poetry, a system of poetic imagery already existed by this early period. The sequence of a poem, moreover, followed a fixed pattern (such as that for the qa\u1e63\u012bdah ). Pre-Islamic poetry was not written down but recited, and sound and rhythm therefore played an important part in its formation, and the r\u0101w\u012b s (reciters) were equally vital to its preservation. A r\u0101w\u012b was associated with some famous bard and, having learned his master\u2019s techniques, might afterward become a poet himself. This kind of apprenticeship to a master whose poetic style was thus continued became a common practice in the Muslim world (especially in Muslim India) right up to the 19th century.",
  "From pre-Islamic times the seven authors of The Seven Odes , already described, are usually singled out for special praise. Their poems and miscellaneous verses were collected during the 8th century and ever since have been the subject of numerous commentaries in the East. They have been studied in Europe since the early 19th century.",
  "The poet Imru\u02be al-Qays (died c. 550 ce ), of the tribe of Kindah , was foremost both in time and in poetic merit. He was a master of love poetry; his frank descriptions of dalliance with his mistresses are considered so seductive that (as orthodox Puritanism claims) the Prophet Muhammad called him \u201cthe leader of poets on the way to Hell.\u201d His style is supple and picturesque. It grips the attention whether his poems sing of his love adventures or describe a seemingly endless rainy night. Of all Classical Arabic poets he is probably the one who appeals most to modern taste. At the other extreme stands Zuhayr , praising the chiefs of the rival tribes of \u02bfAbs and Dhuby\u0101n for ending a long feud. He is chiefly remembered for his serious qa\u1e63\u012bdah in which, old, wise, and experienced, he meditates upon the terrible escalation of war. Various aspects of Bedouin life, as well as the attitude of the Arabs to the rulers of the small kingdom of Al-\u1e24\u012brah on the Euphrates River, are reflected in the poems of al-N\u0101bighah al-Dhuby\u0101n\u012b , \u02bfAmr ibn Kulth\u016bm , and \u1e6carafah ibn al-\u02bfAbd. The boastful pride of the self-centred Arab warrior can be observed best in the poems of al-\u1e24\u0101rith, who became proverbial for his arrogance. \u02bfAntarah ibn Shadd\u0101d, son of an Arab king and an enslaved Black woman, won such fame on the battlefield and for his poetry that he later became the hero of the  Romance of \u02bfAntar  , an Arabic folk romance.",
  "Two other masters can stand beside these seven. Exciting for their savagery and beauty are some poems by Ta\u02beabba\u1e6da Sharran and al-Shanfar\u0101, both outlaw warriors. Their verses reveal the wildness of Bedouin life, with its ideals of bravery, revenge, and hospitality. Ta\u02beabba\u1e6da Sharran is the author of a widely translated \u201cSong of Revenge\u201d (for his uncle), composed in a short, sharp metre. Shanfar\u0101\u2019s l\u0101miyyah (literally \u201cpoem rhyming in [the letter] l\u201d) vividly, succinctly, and with a wealth of detail tells of the experiences to be had from life in the desert. This latter poem has sometimes been considered a forgery, created by a learned grammarian. The suggestion highlights the question, often posed, of how much pre-Islamic poetry is genuine and how much is the product of later scholars. Some modern critics\u2014without proper justification\u2014would dismiss the entire corpus as counterfeit.",
  "While poetry forms the most important part of early Arabic literature and is an effective historical preservation of the Arab past glory, there is also a quantity of prose. Of special interest is the rhymed prose ( saj\u02bf ) peculiar to soothsayers, which developed into an important form of ornate prose writing in every Islamic country. Tales about the adventures and battle days of the various tribes ( ayy\u0101m al-\u02bfArab , or \u201cThe Days of the Arabs\u201d) were told and handed down from generation to generation, usually interspersed with pieces of poetry. Proverbs and proverbial sayings were as common as in most cultures at a comparable level of development. The \u201cliterary\u201d genre most typical of Bedouin life is the mus\u0101marah , or \u201cnighttime conversation,\u201d in which the central subject is elaborated not by plot but by verbal associations that direct the listener\u2019s mind from topic to topic. Thus, the language as language played a most important role. The mus\u0101marah form inspired the later  maq\u0101mah  literature.",
  "It has been said\u2014and this certainly holds true for the mus\u0101marah \u2014that Arabic literature demands attention from its listeners only in short bursts, for listeners are carried from verse to verse, from anecdote to anecdote, from pun to pun, along a theme whose broad outline is entirely familiar. Western scholars of the East have for this reason spoken of the \u201cmolecular,\u201d or \u201catomic,\u201d structure both of Classical Arabic literature and of traditional Islamic thought. An audience listening to one of the ancient bards\u2014or to a modern poet or orator in the Muslim world\u2014would be able to listen without tiring. The sheer emotive power of the Arabic language to enrapture and bewitch its listeners by sound alone should be kept in mind when any piece of Arabic literature is considered. Only a people endowed with peculiar sensibility to the word could properly appreciate the refinement of pre-Islamic poetry and be ready to accept the concept of divine revelation appearing through the word in the Qur\u02be\u0101n.",
  "With the coming of Islam, the attitude of the Arabs toward poetry seems to have changed. The new Muslims, despite their long-standing admiration for powerful language, often shunned poetry as reminiscent of pagan ideals now overthrown, for the Qur\u02be\u0101n (in surah 26:225 ff.) condemned the poets \u201cwho err in every valley, and say what they do not do. Only the perverse follow them!\u201d The Qur\u02be\u0101n, as the revealed word of God, was now considered the supreme manifestation of literary beauty. It became the basis and touchstone of almost every cultural and literary activity and attained a unique position in Arabic literature .",
  "It might be expected that a new and vigorous religion would stimulate a new religious literature to sing of its greatness and glory. This, however, was not the case. Maybe the once-boastful poets felt, at least for a while, that they were nothing but humble servants of God. At any rate, no major poet was inspired by the birth and astonishingly rapid expansion of Islam. Only much later did poets claim that their work was the \u201cheritage of prophecy\u201d or draw upon a tradition that calls the tongues of the poets \u201cthe keys of the treasures beneath the Divine Throne.\u201d The old traditional literary models were still faithfully followed: a famous ode by Ka\u02bfb, the son of Zuhayr , is different from pre-Islamic poetry only insofar as it ends in praise of the Prophet, imploring his forgiveness, instead of eulogizing some Bedouin leader. Muhammad\u2019s rather mediocre eulogist, \u1e24ass\u0101n ibn Th\u0101bit (died c. 659), also slavishly repeated the traditional patterns (even including the praise of wine that had been such a common feature of pre-Islamic poetry at the court of al-\u1e24\u012brah , despite the fact that wine had been by then religiously prohibited).",
  "Religious themes are to be found in the khu\u1e6dbah s, or Friday sermons, which were delivered by governors of the provinces. In these khu\u1e6dbah s, however, political considerations frequently overshadowed the religious and literary aspects. The qu\u1e63\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 (storytellers), who interpreted verses from the Qur\u02be\u0101n, attracted large audiences and may be regarded as the inventors of a popular religious prose. Their interpretations were highly fanciful, however, and hardly squared with the theologian\u2019s orthodoxy.",
  "The desire to preserve words of wisdom is best reflected in the sayings attributed to \u02bfAl\u012b , the fourth caliph (died 661). These, however, were written down, in superbly concise diction, only in the 10th century under the title Nahj al-bal\u0101ghah (\u201cThe Path of Eloquence\u201d), a work that is a masterpiece of the finest Arabic prose and that has inspired numerous commentaries and poetical variations in the various languages of the Islamic world.",
  "The time of the \u201cFour Righteous Caliphs,\u201d as it is called, ended with \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s assassination in 661. The Umayyad dynasty then gained the throne, and a new impetus in poetry soon became perceptible. The Umayyads were by no means a pious dynasty, much enjoying the pleasures of life in their residence in Damascus and in their luxurious castles in the Syrian desert. One of their last rulers, the profligate al-Wal\u012bd ibn Yaz\u012bd (died 744), has become famous not so much as a conqueror (although in 711 the Muslims reached the lower Indus basin, Transoxania, and Spain) but as a poet who excelled in frivolous love verses and poetry in praise of wine. He was fond of short, light metres to match his subjects and rejected the heavier metres preferred by qa\u1e63\u012bdah writers. His verses convey a sense of ease and gracious living. Al-Wal\u012bd was not, however, the first to attempt this kind of poetry: a remarkable poet from Mecca, \u02bfUmar ibn Ab\u012b Rab\u012b\u02bfah (died c. 712/719), had contributed in large measure to the separate development of the love poem (  ghazal  ) from its subordinate place as the opening section of the qa\u1e63\u012bdah . Gentle and charming, written in attractive and lively rhythms, his poems sing of amorous adventures with the ladies who came to Mecca on pilgrimage. His lighthearted melodious poems still appeal to modern readers.",
  "In Medina, on the other hand, idealized love poetry was the vogue; its invention is attributed to Jam\u012bl (died 701), of the tribe \u02bfUdhrah, \u201cwhose members die when they love.\u201d The names of some of these \u201cmartyrs of love,\u201d together with the names of their beloveds, were preserved and eventually became proverbial expressions of the tremendous force of true love. Such was Imru\u02be al-Qays, who went mad because of his passion for Layl\u0101 and was afterward known as Majn\u016bn (the \u201cDemented One\u201d). His story is cherished by later Persian, Turkish, and Urdu poets; as a symbol of complete surrender to the force of love, he is dear both to religious mystics and to secular poets.",
  "Notwithstanding such new developments, the traditional qa\u1e63\u012bdah form of poetry was by no means neglected during the Umayyad period. Moreover, as the satirists of Iraq rose to fame, the naq\u0101\u02bei\u1e0d (slanging matches on parallel themes) between Jar\u012br (died c. 729) and al-Farazdaq (died c. 728 or 730) excited and delighted tribesmen of the rival settlements of Basra and K\u016bfah (places that later also became rival centres of philological and theological schools). The work of these two poets has furnished critics and historians with rich material for a study of the political and social situation in the early 9th century. The wealth of al-Farazdaq\u2019s vocabulary led one of the old Arabic critics to declare: \u201cIf Farazdaq\u2019s poetry did not exist, one-third of the Arabic language would be lost.\u201d Philologists, eager to preserve as much of the classical linguistic heritage as possible, have also paid a great deal of attention to the largely satirical poetry of al-\u1e24u\u1e6day\u02beah (died 674). The fact that Christians as well as Muslims were involved in composing Classical Arabic poetry is proved by the case of al-Akh\u1e6dal (died c. 710), whose work preserves the pre-Islamic tradition of al-\u1e24\u012brah in authentic form. He is particularly noted for his wine songs. Christians and Jews had been included among the pre-Islamic poets.",
  "Prose literature was still restricted to religious writing. The traditions of the Prophet (Hadith) began to be compiled, and, after careful sifting, those regarded as trustworthy were preserved in six great collections during the late 9th century. Two of these\u2014that of al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and that of Muslim ibn al-\u1e24ajj\u0101j \u2014were considered second only to the Qur\u02be\u0101n in religious importance. The first studies of religious law and legal problems, closely connected with the study of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, also belong to that period.",
  "It was not until the Abbasids assumed power in 750, settling in Baghdad, that the golden age of Arabic literature began. The influx of foreign elements added new colour to cultural and literary life. Hellenistic thought and the influence of the ancient cultures of the Middle East, for example, contributed to the rapid intellectual growth of the Muslim community. Its members, seized with insatiable intellectual curiosity, began to adapt elements from all the earlier high cultures and to incorporate them into their own. They thus created the wonderful fabric of Islamic culture that was so much admired in the Middle Ages by western Europe. Indian and Iranian threads were also woven into this fabric, and a new sensitivity to beauty in the field of poetry and the fine arts was cultivated.",
  "The classical Bedouin style was still predominant in literature and was the major preoccupation of grammarians. These men were, as the modern critic Sir Hamilton Gibb emphasized, the true humanists of Islam. Their efforts helped to standardize \u201cHigh Arabic,\u201d giving it an unchangeable structure once and for all. By then the inhabitants of the growing towns in Iraq and Syria were beginning to express their love, hatred, religious fervour, and frivolity in a style more appealing to their fellow townsmen. Poets no longer belonged exclusively to what had been the Bedouin aristocracy. Artisans and freed slaves, of non-Arab origin, were included among their number. Bashsh\u0101r ibn Burd (died c. 784), the son of an enslaved Persian, was the first representative of the new style. This ugly blind workman excelled as a seductive love poet and also as a biting satirist\u2014\u201cNobody could be secure from the itch of his tongue,\u201d it was later said\u2014and he added a new degree of expressiveness to the old forms. The category of zuhdiyyah (ascetic poems) was invented by the poet Ab\u016b al-\u02bfAt\u0101hiyyah (died 825/826) from Basra, the centre of early ascetic movements. His pessimistic thoughts on the transitory nature of this world were uttered in an unpretentious kind of verse that rejected all current notions of style and technical finesse. He had turned to ascetic poetry after efforts at composing love songs.",
  "The same is said of Ab\u016b Nuw\u0101s (died c. 813/815), the most outstanding of the Abbasid poets. His witty and cynical verses are addressed mainly to handsome boys; best known are his scintillating drinking songs. His line \u201cAccumulate as many sins as you can\u201d seems to have been his motto, and, compared with some of his more lascivious lines, even the most daring passages of pre-Islamic poetry sound chaste. Ab\u016b Nuw\u0101s had such an incomparable command over the language, however, that he came to be regarded as one of the greatest Arabic poets of all time. Nevertheless, orthodox Muslims would quote of him and of his imitators the Prophet\u2019s alleged saying that \u201cpoetry is what Satan has spit out,\u201d since he not only described subjects prohibited by religious law but praised them with carefree lightheartedness.",
  "The new approach to poetry that developed during the 9th century was first accorded scholarly discussion in the Kit\u0101b al-bad\u012b\u02bf ( The Book of Tropes ) by Ibn al-Mu\u02bftazz (died 908), caliph for one day, who laid down rules for the use of metaphors , similes , and verbal puns . The ideal of these \u201cmodern\u201d poets was the richest possible embellishment of verses by the use of tropes, brilliant figures of speech, and far-fetched poetic conceits. Many later handbooks of poetics discussed these rules in minute detail, and eventually the increasing use of rhetorical devices no longer produced art but artificiality. (Ibn al-Mu\u02bftazz was himself a fine poet whose descriptions of courtly life and nature are lovely; he even tried to compose an epic poem, a genre otherwise unknown to the Arabs.) The \u201cmodern\u201d poets, sensitive to colours, sounds, and shapes, were also fond of writing short poems on unlikely subjects: a well-bred hunting dog or an inkpot; delicious sweetmeats or jaundice; the ascetic who constantly weeps when he remembers his sins; the luxurious garden parties of the rich; an elegy for a cat; or a description of a green ewer. Their amusing approach, however, was sooner or later bound to lead to mannered compositions. The growing use of colour images may be credited to the increasing Persian influence on Abbasid poetry, for the Persian poets were, as has been often observed, on the whole more disposed to visual than to acoustic imagery.",
  "New attitudes toward love, too, were being gradually developed in poetry. Eventually, what was to become a classic theme, that of \u1e25ubb \u02bfudhr\u012b (\u201c\u02bfUdhrah love\u201d)\u2014the lover would rather die than achieve union with his beloved\u2014was expounded by the \u1e92\u0101hir\u012b theologian Ibn D\u0101\u02be\u016bd (died 910) in his poetic anthology Kit\u0101b al-zahrah ( The Book of the Flower ). This theme was central to the ghazal poetry of the following centuries. Although at first completely secular, it was later taken over as a major concept in mystical love poetry. (The first examples of this adoption, in Iraq and Egypt, took place in Ibn D\u0101\u02be\u016bd\u2019s lifetime.) The wish to die on the path that leads to the beloved became commonplace in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu poetry, and most romances in these languages end tragically. Ibn D\u0101\u02be\u016bd\u2019s influence also spread to the western Islamic world. A century after his death, the theologian Ibn \u1e24azm (died 1064), drawing upon personal experiences, composed in Spain his famous work on \u201cpure love\u201d called \u1e6cawq al-\u1e25am\u0101mah ( The Ring of the Dove ). Its lucid prose, interspersed with poetry, has many times been translated into Western languages.",
  "The conflict between the traditional ideals of poetry and the \u201cmodern\u201d school of the early Abbasid period also led to the growth of a literary criticism, the criteria of which were largely derived from the study of Greek philosophy.",
  "Traditional poetry, meanwhile, was not neglected, but its style was somewhat modified in accordance with the new ideas. Two famous anthologies of Bedouin poetry, both called \u1e24am\u0101sah (\u201cPoems of Bravery\u201d), were collected by the Syrian Ab\u016b Tamm\u0101m (died c. 845) and his disciple al-Bu\u1e25tur\u012b (died 897), both noted classical poets in their own right. They provide an excellent survey of those poems from the stock of early Arabic poetry that were considered worth preserving. A century later Ab\u016b al-Faraj al-I\u1e63bah\u0101n\u012b (died 967), in a multivolume work entitled Kit\u0101b al-agh\u0101n\u012b (\u201cBooks of Songs\u201d), collected a great number of poems and biographical notes on poets and musicians. This material gives a colourful and valuable panorama of literary life in the first four centuries of Islam.",
  "In the mid-10th century a new cultural centre emerged at the small court of the \u1e24amd\u0101nids in Aleppo. Here the Central Asian scholar al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (died 950) wrote his fundamental works on philosophy and musical theory. Here too, for a while, lived Ab\u016b al-\u1e6cayyib al-Mutanabb\u012b (died 965), who is in the mainstream of classical qa\u1e63\u012bdah writers but who surpasses them all in the extravagance of what has been called his \u201creckless audacity of imagination.\u201d He combined some elements of Iraqi and Syrian stylistics with classical ingredients. His compositions\u2014panegyrics of rulers and succinct verses (which are still quoted)\u2014have never ceased to intoxicate the Arabs by their daring hyperbole, their marvelous sound effects, and their formal perfection. Western readers are unlikely to derive as much aesthetic pleasure from Mutanabb\u012b\u2019s poetry as do native speakers of Arabic. They will probably prefer the delicate verses about gardens and flowers by Mutanabb\u012b\u2019s colleague in Aleppo, al-\u1e62anawbar\u012b (died 945), a classic exponent of the descriptive style. This style in time reached Spain, where the superb garden and landscape poetry of Ibn Khaf\u0101jah (died 1139) displayed an even higher degree of elegance and sensitivity than that of his Eastern predecessors.",
  "Before turning to the development of prose, it is necessary to mention a figure unique among those writing in Arabic. This was al-Ma\u02bfarr\u012b (died 1057), a blind poet of Syria, the sincerity and humanity of whose verses continue to appeal greatly to young Arabs. But al-Ma\u02bfarr\u012b\u2019s vocabulary is so difficult, his verses, with their double rhymes, are so compressed in meaning, that even his contemporaries, flocking to his lectures, had to ask him to interpret their significance. His outlook is deeply pessimistic and skeptical. Although his poems display a mastery of the Arabic traditional stylistic devices, they run counter to the conventional ideals of Arab heroism by speaking of bitter disappointment and emphasizing asceticism, compassion, and the avoidance of procreation.",
  "Taking reason for his guide he judges men and things with a freedom which must have seemed scandalous to the rulers and privileged classes of the day. Among his meditations on the human tragedy a fierce hatred of injustice, hypocrisy, and superstition blazes out. Vice and folly are laid bare in order that virtue and wisdom may be sought\u2026",
  "says Reynold A. Nicholson, al-Ma\u02bfarr\u012b\u2019s foremost interpreter in the West, who also translated his Ris\u0101lat al-ghufr\u0101n (\u201cThe Epistle of Forgiveness\u201d; Eng. trans. Risalat ul Ghufran: A Divine Comedy ), which describes a visit to the otherworld. Ma\u02bfarr\u012b\u2019s extremely erudite book also contains sarcastic criticism of Arabic literature. His Al-Fu\u1e63\u016bl wa al-gh\u0101y\u0101t (\u201cParagraphs and Periods\u201d) is an ironic commentary on humanity and nature but is presented as a sequence of pious exhortations in rhymed prose. It has scandalized the pious, some of whom see it as a parody of the Qur\u02be\u0101n. Ma\u02bfarr\u012b\u2019s true intention in writing this book is unknown.",
  "During the Abbasid period, literary prose also began to develop. Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf (died c. 756), of Persian origin, translated the fables of Bidpai into Arabic under the title Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah . These fables provided Islamic culture with a seemingly inexhaustible treasure of tales and parables, which are to be found in different guises throughout the whole of Muslim literature. He also introduced into Arabic the fictitious chronicles of the Persian Khvat\u0101y-n\u0101mak (\u201cBook of Kings\u201d). This was the source of a kind of pre-Islamic mythology that the literati preferred above the somewhat meagre historical accounts of the Arab pagan past otherwise available to them. These activities demanded a smooth prose style, and Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf has therefore rightly been regarded as the inaugurator of what is called \u201csecretarial literature\u201d (that produced by secretaries in the official chancelleries). He also translated writings on ethics and the conduct of government, which helped to determine the rules of etiquette ( adab ). His works are the prototype of the \u201cMirror for Princes\u201d literature, which flourished during the late Middle Ages both in Iran and in the West. In this literature a legendary Persian counselor, Bozorgmehr, was presented as a paragon of wise conduct. Later, stories were invented that combined Qur\u02be\u0101nic heroes with historical characters from the Iranian past.",
  "A growing interest in things outside the limits of Bedouin life was reflected in a quantity of didactic yet entertaining prose by such masters as the broad-minded and immensely learned al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 (died 869). In response to the wide-ranging curiosity of urban society, the list of his subjects includes treatises on theology, on misers, on donkeys, and on thieves. His masterpiece is Kit\u0101b al-\u1e25ayaw\u0101n (\u201cThe Book of Animals\u201d), which has little to do with zoology but is a mine of information about Arab proverbs, traditions, superstitions, and the like. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93\u2019s style is vigorous, loquacious, and uninhibited. His work, however, is not well constructed, and it lacks the clear sobriety of the \u201csecretarial style.\u201d Yet the glimpses it affords into the life of various strata of society during the 9th century have rightly attracted the special interest of Western scholars. Less impressive, but almost as multifaceted, are the treatises of Ibn Ab\u012b al-Duny\u0101 (died 894).",
  "The concept of adab was soon enlarged to include not only educational prose dealing with etiquette for all classes of people but belles lettres in general. The classic example of Arabic style for prose writers in this field, accepted as such for almost a millennium, is the writing of the Persian Ibn Qutaybah (died 889). His Kitab \u02bfuy\u016bn al-akhb\u0101r (\u201cBook of Choice Narratives\u201d), in 10 books, each dealing with a given subject, provided a model to which numberless essayists in the Muslim world conformed. In his book on poetry and poets, Ibn Qutaybah dared, for the first time, to doubt openly that pre-Islamic poetry was incomparable. The most vigorous prose style was achieved by Ab\u016b \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-Taw\u1e25\u012bd\u012b (died 1023), who portrayed the weaknesses of the two leading viziers, both notorious for their literary ambitions, \u201c\u2026with such bitterness,\u201d as Gibb remarks, \u201cthat the book was reputed to bring misfortune upon all who possessed a copy.\u201d This work, like others by Taw\u1e25\u012bd\u012b that have quite recently been discovered, reveals the author\u2019s sagacity and striking eloquence. His correspondence on problems of philosophy with Ibn Miskawayh (died 1030), the author of a widely circulated book on ethics and of a general history, helps to complete the picture of this extraordinary writer.",
  "Sometime about 800 the Arabs had learned the art of papermaking from the Chinese. Thenceforth, cheap writing material was available, and literary output was prodigious. The Fihrist (\u201cIndex\u201d), compiled by the bookseller Ibn al-Nad\u012bm in 988, gave a full account of the Arabic literature extant in the 10th century. It covered all kinds of literature, from philology to alchemy , but most of these works unfortunately have been lost. In those years manuals of composition ( insh\u0101\u02be ) were written elaborating the technique of secretarial correspondence, and they grew into an accepted genre in Arabic as well as in Persian and Turkish literature. The devices thought indispensable for elegance in modern poetry were applied to prose. The products were mannered, full of puns, verbal tricks, riddles, and the like. The new style, which was also to affect the historian\u2019s art in later times, makes a good deal of this post-Classical Arabic prose look very different from the terse and direct expression characteristic of the early specimens. Rhymed prose, which at one time had been reserved for such religious occasions as the Friday sermons, was now regarded as an essential part of elegant style.",
  "This rhetorical artistry found its most superb expression in the maq\u0101mah , a form invented by al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b (died 1008). Its master, however, was al-\u1e24ar\u012br\u012b (died 1122), postmaster (head of the intelligence service) at Basra and an accomplished writer on grammatical subjects. His 50 maq\u0101mah s, which tell the adventures of Ab\u016b Zayd al-Sar\u016bj\u012b, with a wealth of language and learning, come closer to the Western concept of short story than anything else in Classical Arabic literature. They abound in verbal conceits, ambivalence, assonance, alliteration, palindromes; they change abruptly from earnest to jest, from the crude to the most sublime, as the mid-20th-century scholar G.E. von Grunebaum pointed out in his evaluation of this form, which he regarded as the most typical literary reflection of the Islamic spirit. The work of al-\u1e24ar\u012br\u012b has certainly been widely admired in the East; it has been imitated in Syriac and in Hebrew and has formed part of the syllabus in Muslim high schools of India. The pleasure to be derived from the brilliant artifice and ingenuity behind such compositions has led to their being imitated in other literary fields: quite often, in later Persian literature, one finds poems\u2014sometimes whole books\u2014composed of letters without diacritical marks (which distinguish otherwise similar-looking letters) or even made up entirely of unconnected letters. In India, even a commentary on the Qur\u02be\u0101n, in undotted letters, was written (by Fayz\u012b; died 1595).",
  "The Arabic literature of Andalusian Spain and of the whole Maghrib developed parallel with that of the eastern countries but came to full flower somewhat later. C\u00f3rdoba, the seat of the Umayyad rulers , was the centre of cultural life. Its wonderful mosque inspired Muslim poets right up to the 20th century (such as Sir Mu\u1e25ammad Iqb\u0101l , whose Urdu ode, \u201cThe Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba,\u201d was written in 1935). Andalusian Spain was a favourite topic for reformist novelists of 19th-century Muslim India, who contrasted their own country\u2019s troubled state with the glory of classical Islamic civilization. Andalusian Spain reached its cultural, political, and literary heyday under \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n III (ruled 912\u2013961). Literary stylistic changes, as noted in Iraq and Syria, spread to the west: there the old Bedouin style had always been rare and soon gave way to descriptive poetry and love poetry. Ibn H\u0101ni\u02be (died 973) of Sevilla (Seville) has been praised as the western counterpart of al-Mutanabb\u012b, largely because of his eulogies of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu\u02bfizz , who at that time still resided in North Africa. The entertaining prose style of Ibn \u02bfAbd Rabbih (died 940) in his Al-\u02bfIqd al-far\u012bd (\u201cThe Unique Necklace\u201d) is similar to that of his elder contemporary Ibn Qutaybah, and his book in fact became more famous than that of his predecessor. Writers on music and philology also flourished in Spain; literary criticism was practiced by Ibn Rash\u012bq (died 1064) and later by al-Qar\u1e6d\u0101jann\u012b (died 1285) in Tunis. Ibn \u1e24azm (died 1064), theologian and accomplished writer on pure love, has already been mentioned.",
  "Philosophy, medicine, and theology, all of which flourished in the Abbasid East, were also of importance in the Maghrib , and from there strong influences reached medieval Europe. The influences often came through the mediation of the Jews, who, along with numerous Christians, were largely Arabized in their cultural and literary outlook. The eastern Muslim countries could boast of the first systematic writers in the field of philosophy, including al-Kind\u012b (died c. 870), al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (died 950), and especially Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101; died 1037). Avicenna\u2019s work in philosophy, science, and medicine was outstanding and was appreciated as such in Europe. He also composed religious treatises and tales with a mystical slant. One of his romances was reworked by the Maghribi philosopher Ibn \u1e6cufayl (died 1185/86) in his book \u1e24ayy ibn Yaq\u1e93\u0101n (\u201cAlive Son of Awake\u201d; Eng. trans. Ibn Tufayl\u2019s Hayy ibn Yaqzan: A Philosophical Tale ). It is the story of a self-taught man who lived on a lonely island and who, in his maturity, attained the full knowledge taught by philosophers and prophets. This theme was elaborated often in later European literature.",
  "The dominating figure in the kingdom of the Almohads , however, was the philosopher Averro\u00ebs (Ibn Rushd; died 1198), court physician of the Amazigh (Berber) kings in Marr\u0101kush (Marrakech) and famous as the great Arab commentator on Aristotle . The importance of his frequently misinterpreted philosophy in the formation of medieval Christian thought is well known. Among his many other writings, especially notable is his merciless reply to an attack on philosophy made by al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (died 1111). Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b had called his attack Tah\u0101fut al-fal\u0101sifah ( The Incoherence of the Philosophers ), while Averro\u00ebs\u2019s equally famous reply was entitled Tah\u0101fut tah\u0101fut ( The Incoherence of the Incoherence ).",
  "The Persian-born al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b had, after giving up a splendid scholarly career, become the most influential representative of moderate Sufism . His chief work, I\u1e25y\u0101\u02be \u02bful\u016bm al-d\u012bn (\u201cThe Revival of the Religious Sciences\u201d), was based on personal religious experiences and is a perfect introduction to the pious Muslim\u2019s way to God. It inspired much later religious poetry and prose.",
  "The numerous writings by mystics, who often expressed their wisdom in rather cryptic language (thereby contributing to the profundity of Arabic vocabulary), and the handbooks of religious teaching produced in eastern Arab and Persian areas (Sarr\u0101j, Kal\u0101b\u0101dh\u012b, Qushayr\u012b, and, in Muslim India, al-Hujw\u012br\u012b) are generally superior to those produced in western Muslim countries. Yet the greatest Islamic theosophist of all, Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b (died 1240), was Spanish in origin and was educated in the Spanish tradition. His writings, in both poetry and prose, shaped large parts of Islamic thought during the following centuries. Much of the later literature of eastern Islam, particularly Persian and Indo-Persian mystical writings, indeed, can be understood only in the light of his teachings. Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b\u2019s lyrics are typical ghazal s, sweet and flowing. From the late 9th century, Arabic-speaking mystics had been composing verses often meant to be sung in their meetings. At first a purely religious vocabulary was employed, but soon the expressions began to oscillate between worldly and heavenly love. The ambiguity thus achieved eventually became a characteristic feature of Persian and Turkish lyrics.",
  "Among the Arabs, religious poetry mainly followed the classical qa\u1e63\u012bdah models, and the poets lavishly decorated their panegyrics to the Prophet Muhammad with every conceivable rhetorical embellishment. Examples of this trend include Al-Burdah (Eng. trans. The Poem of the Scarf and The Prophet\u2019s Mantle ) of al-Bu\u1e63\u012br\u012b (died 1298), upon which dozens of commentaries have been written (and which has been translated into most of the languages spoken by Muslims because of the power to bless attributed to it). More sophisticated but less well known is an ode on the Prophet by the Iraqi poet \u1e62af\u012b al-D\u012bn al-\u1e24illi (died 1350), which contains 151 rhetorical figures. The \u201cletters of spiritual guidance\u201d developed by the mystics are worth mentioning as a literary genre. They have been popular everywhere; from the western Islamic world the letters of Ibn \u02bfAbb\u0101d (died 1390) of Ronda (in Spain) are outstanding examples of this category, being written clearly and lucidly.",
  "The Maghrib also made a substantial contribution to geographical literature, a field eagerly cultivated by Arab scholars since the 9th century. The Sicilian geographer al-Shar\u012bf al-Idr\u012bs\u012b produced a famous map of the world and accompanied it with a detailed description in his Kit\u0101b nuzhat al-musht\u0101q f\u012b ikhtir\u0101q al-\u0101f\u0101q (1154; \u201cThe Pleasure Excursion of One Who Is Eager to Traverse the Regions of the World\u201d), which he dedicated to his patron, Roger II . The Spanish traveler Ibn Jubayr (died 1217), while on pilgrimage to Mecca, kept notes of his experiences and adventures. The resulting book became a model for the later pilgrims\u2019 manuals that are found everywhere in the Muslim world. The Maghribi explorer Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah (died 1368/69 or 1377) described his extensive travels to East Asia, India, and Mali in a book filled with information about the cultural state of the Muslim world at that time. The value of his narrative is enhanced by the simple and pleasing style in which it was written.",
  "In the field of poetry, Spain, which produced a considerable number of masters in the established poetical forms, also began to popularize strophic poetry, possibly deriving from indigenous models. The  muwashsha\u1e25  (\u201cgirdled\u201d) poem, written in the classical short metres and arranged in four- to six-line stanzas, was elaborated, enriched by internal rhymes, and, embodying some popular expressions in the poem\u2019s final section, soon achieved a standardized form. The theme is almost always love. Among the greatest lyric poets of Spain was Ibn Zayd\u016bn of C\u00f3rdoba (died 1071), who was of noble birth. After composing some charming love songs dedicated to the Umayyad princess Wall\u0101dah, he turned his hand to poetic epistles. He is the author of a beautiful muwashsha\u1e25 about his hometown, which many later poets imitated. When the muwashsha\u1e25 was transplanted to the eastern Arabic countries, however, it lost its original spontaneity and became as stereotyped as every other lyric form of expression during the later Middle Ages. Another strophic form developed in Spain is the songlike zajal (melody), interesting for its embodiment of dialect phrases and the use of occasional words from Romance languages . Its master was Ibn Quzm\u0101n of C\u00f3rdoba (died 1160), whose lifestyle was similar to that of Western troubadours. His approach to life as expressed in these melodious poems, together with their mixed idiom, suggests an interrelationship with the vernacular troubadour poetry of Spain and France.",
  "Any survey of western Muslim literary achievements would be incomplete if it did not mention the most profound historiographer of the Islamic world, the Tunisian Ibn Khald\u016bn (died 1406). History has been called the characteristic science of the Muslims because of the Qur\u02be\u0101nic admonition to discover signs of the divine in the fate of past peoples. Islamic historiography has produced histories of the Muslim conquests, world histories, histories of dynasties, court annals, and biographical works classified by occupation\u2014scholars, poets, and theologians. Yet, notwithstanding their learning, none of the earlier writers had attempted to produce a comprehensive view of history. Ibn Khald\u016bn, in the famous Muqaddimah (\u201cIntroduction\u201d) to a projected general history, Kit\u0101b al-\u02bfibar, sought to explain the basic factors in the historical development of the Islamic countries. His own experiences, gained on a variety of political missions in North Africa, proved useful in establishing general principles that he could apply to the manifestations of Islamic civilization. He created, in fact, the first \u201csociological\u201d study of history, free from bias. Yet his book was little appreciated by his fellow historians, who still clung to the method of accumulating facts without shaping them properly into a well-structured whole. Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work eventually attracted the interest of Western scholars of Asia, historians, and sociologists alike, and some of his analyses are still held in great esteem.",
  "Ibn Khald\u016bn, who had served in his youth as ambassador to Pedro I of Castile and in his old age as emissary to Timur , died in Cairo. After the fall of Baghdad in 1258, Cairo had become the centre of Muslim learning. Historians there recorded every detail of the daily life and the policies of the Mamluk sultans; theologians and philologists worked under the patronage of Turkish and Circassian rulers who often did not speak a word of Arabic. The amusing semicolloquial style of the historian Ibn Iy\u0101s (died after 1521) is an interesting example of the turn toward more direct and less ornate use of Arabic. While Classical Arabic was still the ideal of the literate, it had become exclusively a \u201clearned\u201d language. Even some copyists who transcribed classical works showed a deplorable lack of grammatical knowledge. It is hardly surprising that poetry composed under such circumstances should be restricted to insipid versification and the repetition of well-worn clich\u00e9s.",
  "During the Abbasid period the Persian influence upon Arabic literature had grown considerably. At the same time, a distinct Modern Persian literature came into existence in northeastern Iran, where the house of the Samanids of Bukhara and Samarkand had revived the memory of Sasanian glories. The first famous representative of this new literature was the poet R\u016bdak\u012b (died 940/941), of whose qa\u1e63\u012bdah s only a few have survived. He also worked on a Persian version of Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah , however, and on a version of the Sendb\u0101d-n\u0101meh (\u201cThe Book of Sendb\u0101d [Sindbad]\u201d). R\u016bdak\u012b\u2019s poetry, modeled on the Arabic rules of prosody that without exception had been applied to Persian, already points ahead to many of the characteristic features of later Persian poetry. The imagery in particular is sophisticated, although when compared with the mannered writing of subsequent times his verse was considered sadly simple. From the 10th century onward Persian poems were written at almost every court in the Iranian areas, sometimes in dialectical variants (for example, in \u1e6cabarest\u0101ni dialect at the Zey\u0101rid court). In many cases the poets were bilingual, excelling in both Arabic and Persian (a gift shared by many non-Arab writers up to the 19th century).",
  "The first important centre of Persian literature existed at Ghazna (present-day Ghazn\u012b, Afghanistan), at the court of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Ghazna (died 1030) and his successors, who eventually extended their empire to northwestern India. Himself an orthodox warrior, Ma\u1e25m\u016bd in later love poetry was transformed into a symbol of \u201ca slave of his slave\u201d because of his love for a Turkmen officer, Ay\u0101z. Under the Ghaznavids, lyric and epic poetry both developed, as did the panegyric. Classical Iranian topics became the themes of poetry, resulting in such diverse works as the love story of V\u0101meq and \u02bfAzr\u0101 (possibly of Greek origin) and the Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh ( see below ). A number of gifted poets praised Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, his successors, and his ministers. Among them was Farrokh\u012b of Seistan (died 1037), who wrote a powerful elegy on Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u2019s death, one of the finest compositions of Persian court poetry.",
  "The main literary achievement of the Ghaznavid period, however, was that of Ferdows\u012b (died c. 1020). He compiled the inherited tales and legends about the Persian kings in one grand epic, the Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh (\u201cBook of Kings\u201d), which contains between 35,000 and 60,000 verses in short rhyming couplets. It deals with the history of Iran from its beginnings\u2014that is, from the \u201ctime\u201d of the mythical kings\u2014passing on to historical events, giving information about the acceptance of the Zoroastrian faith , Alexander \u2019s invasion, and, eventually, the conquest of the country by the Arabs. A large part of the work centres on tales of the hero Rostam. These stories are essentially part of a different culture, thus revealing something about the Indo-European sources of Iranian mythology. The struggle between Iran and T\u016br\u0101n (the central Asian steppes from which new waves of nomadic conquerors distributed Iran\u2019s urban culture) forms the central theme of the book, and the importance of the legitimate succession of kings, who are endowed with royal charisma, is reflected throughout the composition. The poem contains very few Arabic words and is often considered the masterpiece of Persian national literature, although it lacks proper historical perspective. Its episodes have been the inspiration of miniaturists since the 14th century. Numerous attempts have been made to emulate it in Iran, India, and Turkey.",
  "Other epic poems, on a variety of subjects, were composed during the 11th century. The first example is Asad\u012b\u2019s (died c. 1072) didactic Garsh\u0101sp-n\u0101meh (\u201cBook of Garsh\u0101sp\u201d), whose hero is very similar to Rostam. The tales of Alexander and his journeys through foreign lands were another favourite topic.",
  "Poetical romances were also being written at this time. They include the tale of Varqeh o-Golsh\u0101h (\u201cVarqeh and Golsh\u0101h\u201d) by \u02bfEyy\u016bq\u012b (11th century) and V\u012bs o-R\u0101m\u012bn (\u201cV\u012bs and R\u0101m\u012bn\u201d) by Fakhr od-D\u012bn Gorg\u0101n\u012b (died after 1055), which has parallels with the Tristan story of medieval romance. These were soon superseded, however, by the great romantic epics of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b of Ganja (died c. 1209), in Caucasia. The latter are known as the Khamseh (\u201cThe Quintuplet\u201d or \u201cThe Five\u201d) and, though the names of V\u012bs or V\u0101meq continued for some time to serve as symbols of the longing lover, it was the poetical work of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b that supplied subsequent writers with a rich store of images, similes, and stories to draw upon. The first work in his collection, Makhzan ol-asr\u0101r (\u201cTreasury of Mysteries\u201d), is didactic in intention. The subjects of the following three poems are traditional love stories. The first is the Arabic romance of Majn\u016bn, who went mad with love for Layl\u0101. Second is the Persian historical tale of Sh\u012br\u012bn, a Christian princess, loved by both the Sasanian ruler Khosrow II Parv\u012bz and the stonecutter Farh\u0101d. The third story, Haft peykar (\u201cSeven Beauties\u201d), deals with the adventures of Bahr\u0101m G\u016br, a Sasanian prince, and seven princesses, each connected with one day of the week, one particular star, one colour, one perfume, and so on. The last part of the Khamseh is Eskandar-n\u0101meh , which relates the adventures of Alexander the Great in Africa and Asia, as well as his discussions with the wise philosophers. It thus follows the traditions about Alexander and his tutor, Aristotle, emphasizing the importance of a counselor-philosopher in the service of a mighty emperor. Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\u2019s ability to present a picture of life through highly refined language and a wholly apt choice of images is quite extraordinary. Human feelings, as he describes them, are fully believable; and his characters are drawn with a keen insight into human nature. Not surprisingly, Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\u2019s work inspired countless poets\u2019 imitations in different languages\u2014including Turkish, Kurdish, and Urdu\u2014while painters illustrated his stories for centuries afterward.",
  "In addition to epic poetry, the lesser forms, such as the qa\u1e63\u012bdah and ghazal , developed during the 11th and 12th centuries. Many poets wrote at the courts of the Seljuqs and also at the Ghaznavid court in Lahore, where the poet Mas\u02bf\u016bd-e Sa\u02bfd-e Salm\u0101n (died 1121) composed a number of heartfelt qa\u1e63\u012bdah s during his political imprisonment. They are outstanding examples of the category of the \u1e25absiyyah (prison poem), which usually reveals more of the author\u2019s personal feelings than other literary forms. Other famous examples of \u1e25absiyyah s include those written by the Arab knight Ab\u016b Fir\u0101s (died 968) in a Byzantine prison; by Mu\u1e25ammad II al-Mu\u02bftamid of Sevilla (died 1095) in the dungeons of the Almohads; by the 12th-century Persian Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b ; by the Urdu poets Gh\u0101lib , in the 19th century, and Faiz, in the 20th; and by the modern Turkish poet Naz\u0131m Hikmet (died 1963).",
  "The most-complicated forms were mastered by poets of the very early period, especially Qa\u1e6dr\u0101n, who was born near Tabr\u012bz (now in Iran) and died after 1072. Through their display of virtuosity for virtuosity\u2019s sake, his qa\u1e63\u012bdah s reached the limits of artificiality. The court poets tried to top one another in the accumulation of complex metaphors and paradoxes, each hoping to win the coveted title \u201cPrince of Poets.\u201d",
  " Anvar\u012b (died c. 1189), whose patrons were the Seljuqs , is considered the most-accomplished writer of panegyrics in the Persian tongue. His verses contain little descriptive material but abound in learned allusions. His \u201cTears of Khor\u0101s\u0101n,\u201d mourning the passing of Seljuq glory, is among the best-known of Persian qa\u1e63\u012bdah s.",
  "In the west of Iran, Anvar\u012b\u2019s contemporary Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b (died c. 1190), who wrote mainly at the court of the Sh\u012brv\u0101n-Sh\u0101hs of Transcaucasia, is the outstanding master of the hyperbolic style. His father was a Muslim, but his mother was a Christian from the Church of the East , and his imagery has more than the usual amount of allusions to Christian themes. His vocabulary seems inexhaustible; he uses uncommon rhetorical devices and very strong language. His poems are as impressive as his poignant antithetic formulations. Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b\u2019s verses on the ruined \u1e6c\u0101q Kisr\u0101 at Ctesiphon on the Tigris have become proverbial. His qa\u1e63\u012bdah s on the pilgrimage to Mecca, which also inspired his mas\u0304naw\u012b , Tu\u1e25fat al-\u02bfIr\u0101qayn (\u201cGift of the Two Iraqs\u201d), translate most eloquently the feelings of a Muslim at the festive occasion. In the hand of lesser poets, however, qa\u1e63\u012bdah writing became more and more conventionalized, repeating clich\u00e9s and employing inflated terms entirely devoid of feeling.",
  "The Ghaznavid and Seljuq periods produced first-rate scholars such as al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b (died 1048) who, writing in Arabic, investigated Hinduism and gave the first unprejudiced account of India\u2014indeed, of any non-Islamic culture. He also wrote notable books on chronology and history. In his search for pure knowledge he is undoubtedly one of the greatest minds in Islamic history. Interest in philosophy is represented by N\u0101\u1e63er-e Khusraw (died 1072/77), who acted for a time as a missionary for the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bliyyah , a branch of Shi\u02bfi Islam. His book about his journey to Egypt, entitled Safar-n\u0101meh (translated into English as Diary of a Journey Through Syria and Palestine ), is a pleasing example of simple, clearly expressed, early Persian prose. His poetical works in the main seek to combine Greek wisdom and Islamic thought: the gnostic Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b interpretation of Islam seemed, to him, an ideal vehicle for a renaissance of the basic Islamic truths.",
  "The work done in mathematics by early Arabic scholars and by al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b was continued by Omar Khayyam (died 1131), to whom the Seljuq empire in fact owes the reform of its calendar. But Omar has become famous in the West through the very free adaptations by Edward FitzGerald of his rob\u0101\u02bfiyy\u0101t . These quatrains have been translated into almost every known language and are largely responsible for colouring European ideas about Persian poetry. Some scholars have doubted the authenticity of these verses. Since FitzGerald\u2019s time, many more faithful translations have been published.",
  "The quatrain is an easy form to use\u2014many have been scribbled on Persian pottery of the 13th century\u2014and the same verse has been attributed to many different authors. The latest research into the question of the rob\u0101\u02bfiyy\u0101t has established that a certain number of the quatrains can, indeed, be traced back to the great scientist who condensed in them his feelings and thoughts, his skepticism and love, in such an enthralling way that they appeal to every reader. The imagery he uses, however, is entirely inherited; none of it is original. (One of the most noted, and notorious, writers of this genre was the female poet Mahsat\u012b [first half of the 12th century], who frequently addressed members of different professions in rather frivolous lines.) The quatrain was also popular as a means of embodying pieces of mystical wisdom. One has to do away with the old theory that the first author of such mystical rob\u0101\u02bfiyy\u0101t was Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd ibn Ab\u016b al-Khayr (died 1049). A number of his contemporaries, however, including B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e6c\u0101her \u02bfOry\u0101n (died after 1055), used simpler forms of the quatrain, sometimes in order to express their mystical concepts.",
  "Whereas the mystical thought stemming from Iran had formerly been written in Arabic, writers from the 11th century onward turned to Persian. Along with works of pious edification and theoretical discussions, what was to be one of the most common types of Persian literature came into existence: the mystical poem. Khwajah \u02bfAbd All\u0101h al-An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b of Her\u0101t (died 1088), a prolific writer on religious topics in both Arabic and Persian, first popularized the literary \u201cprayer,\u201d or mystical contemplation, written in Persian in rhyming prose interspersed with verses. San\u0101\u02be\u012b (died 1131?), at one time a court poet of the Ghaznavids, composed the first mystical epic, the didactic \u1e24ad\u012bqat al-\u1e25aq\u012bqat wa shar\u012b\u02bfat al-\u1e6dariqah (\u201cThe Garden of Truth and the Law of the Path\u201d), which has some 10,000 verses. In this lengthy and rather dry poem, the pattern for all later mystical mas\u0304nav\u012b s is established: wisdom is embodied in stories and anecdotes; parables and proverbs are woven into the texture of the story, eventually leading back to the main subject, although the argument is without thread and the narration puzzling to follow. Among San\u0101\u02be\u012b\u2019s smaller mas\u0304nav\u012b s, Sayr al-\u02bfib\u0101d il\u0101 al-ma\u02bf\u0101d (\u201cThe Journey of the Servants to the Place of Return\u201d) deserves special mention. Its theme is the journey of the spirit through the spheres, a subject dear to the mystics and still employed in modern times as, for example, by Iqb\u0101l in his Persian J\u0101v\u012bd-n\u0101meh (1932; \u201cThe Song of Eternity\u201d).",
  "San\u0101\u02be\u012b\u2019s epic endeavours were continued by one of the most prolific writers in the Persian tongue, Far\u012bd al-D\u012bn \u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r (died c. 1220). He was a born storyteller, a fact that emerges from his lyrics but even more so from his works of edification. The most famous among his mas\u0304nav\u012b s is the Man\u1e6deq al-\u1e6dayr ( The Conference of the Birds ), modeled after some Arabic allegories. It is the story of 30 birds who, in search of their spiritual king, journey through seven valleys. The poem is full of tales, some of which have been translated even into the most remote Islamic languages. (The story of the pious Sheykh \u1e62an\u02bf\u0101n, who fell in love with a Christian maiden, is found, for example, in Kashmiri .) \u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r\u2019s symbolism of the soul-bird was perfectly in accord with the existing body of imagery beloved of Persian poetry, but it was he who added a scene in which the birds eventually realize their own identity with God (because they, being s\u012b morgh , or \u201c30 birds,\u201d are identified with the mystical S\u012bmorgh, who represents God). Also notable are his El\u0101h\u012b-n\u0101meh (\u201cThe Book of God\u201d), an allegory of a king and his six sons, and his profound Mo\u1e63\u012bbat-n\u0101meh (\u201cBook of Affliction\u201d), which closes with its hero\u2019s being immersed in the ocean of his soul after wandering through the 40 stages of his search for God. The epic exteriorizes the mystic\u2019s experiences in the 40 days of seclusion.",
  "The most famous of the Persian mystical mas\u0304nav\u012b s is by Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b (died 1273) and is known simply as the Mas\u0304nav\u012b . It comprises some 26,000 verses and is a complete\u2014though quite disorganized\u2014encyclopaedia of all the mystical thought, theories, and images known in the 13th century. It is regarded by most of the Persian-reading orders of Sufis as second in importance only to the Qur\u02be\u0101n. Its translation into many Islamic languages and the countless commentaries written on it up to the present day indicate its importance in the formation of Islamic poetry and religious thought. Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn, who hailed from Balkh (in present-day Afghanistan) and settled in Konya (in present-day Turkey), the capital of the R\u016bm, or Anatolian Seljuqs (and hence was surnamed \u201cR\u016bm\u012b\u201d), was also the author of love lyrics whose beauty surpasses even that of the tales in the Mas\u0304nav\u012b . Mystical love poetry had been written since the days of San\u0101\u02be\u012b, and theories of love had been explained in the most subtle prose and sensitive verses by the Sufis of the early 12th century. Yet R\u016bm\u012b\u2019s experience of mystical love for the wandering mystic, Shams al-D\u012bn of Tabr\u012bz, was so ardent and enraptured him to such an extent that he identified himself completely with Shams, going so far as to use the beloved\u2019s name as his own pen name. His dithyrambic lyrics, numbering more than 30,000 verses altogether, are not at all abstract or romantic. On the contrary, their vocabulary and imagery are taken directly from everyday life, so that they are vivid, fresh, and convincing. Often their rhythm invites the reader to partake in the mystical dance practiced by R\u016bm\u012b\u2019s followers, the Mawlawiyyah (the name is derived from the honorific \u201cMawl\u0101n\u0101\u201d\u2014meaning \u201cOur Lord\u201d\u2014often bestowed on R\u016bm\u012b). His verses sometimes approach the form of popular folk poetry. Indeed, R\u016bm\u012b is reputed to have written mostly under inspiration, and, despite his remarkable poetical technique, the sincerity of his love and longing is never overshadowed, nor is his personality veiled. In these respects he is unique in Persian literature.",
  "During the 13th century the Islamic lands were exposed, on the political plane, to the onslaught of the Mongols and the abolition of the Abbasid caliphate, while vast areas were laid to waste. Yet this was in fact the period in which Islamic literatures reached their zenith. Apart from R\u016bm\u012b\u2019s superb poetry, written in the comparative safety of Konya, there was also the work of the Egyptian Ibn al-F\u0101ri\u1e0d (died 1235), who composed some magnificent, delicately written mystical poems in qa\u1e63\u012bdah style, and that of Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b , who composed love lyrics and numerous theosophical works that were to become standard.",
  "In Iran one of the greatest literati, Sa\u02bfd\u012b , (died 1291), returned about 1256 to his birthplace, Sh\u012br\u0101z, after years of journeying, and his B\u016bst\u0101n ( The Orchard ) and Gulist\u0101n ( The Rose Garden ) have been popular ever since. The B\u016bst\u0101n is a didactic poem telling wise and uplifting moral tales, written in polished, easy-flowing style and a simple metre. The Gulist\u0101n , completed one year later, in 1258, has been judged \u201cthe finest flower that could blossom in a Sultan\u2019s garden\u201d ( Johann Gottfried von Herder ). Its eight chapters deal with different aspects of human life and behaviour. At first sight its prose and poetical fragments appear to be simple and unassuming, but not a word could be changed without destroying the perfect harmony of the sound, imagery, and content. Sa\u02bfd\u012b\u2019s Gulist\u0101n is thus essential in discovering the nature of the finest Persian literary style. Since the mid-17th century its moralizing stories have been translated into many Western languages. Sa\u02bfd\u012b was likewise the author of some spirited ghazal s; he may have been the first writer in Iran to compose the sort of love poetry that is now thought of as characteristic of the ghazal . A few of his qa\u1e63\u012bdah s are also of note, although he is at his best in shorter forms. His elegant aphoristic poems, words of wisdom, and sensible advice all display what has been called the philosophy of common sense\u2014how to act in any given situation so as to make the best of it both for oneself and others, basing one\u2019s conduct on the virtues of gentleness, elegance, modesty, and polite behaviour.",
  "The influence of mysticism, on the one hand, and of the elaborate Persian poetical tradition, on the other, is apparent during the later decades of the 13th century, both in Anatolia and in Muslim India. The Persian mystic \u02bfIr\u0101q\u012b (died 1289), a master of delightful love lyrics, lived for almost 25 years in Multan (in present-day Pakistan), where his lively ghazal s are still sung. His short treatises, in a mixture of poetry and prose (and written under Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b\u2019s influence), have been imitated often.",
  "While in Multan he may have met the young Am\u012br Khosrow of Delhi (died 1325), who was one of the most versatile authors to write in Persian, not only in India but in the entire realm of Persian culture. Am\u012br Khosrow, son of a Turkish officer but whose mother was Indian, is often styled, because of the sweetness of his speech, \u201cthe parrot of India.\u201d (In Persian, it should be noted, parrots are always \u201csugar-talking\u201d; they are, moreover, connected with paradise and are thought of as wise birds\u2014thus models of the sweet-voiced sage.) He wrote panegyrics of seven successive kings of Delhi and was also a pioneer of Indian Muslim music. Imitating Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Khamseh , Khosrow introduced a novelistic strain into the mas\u0304nav\u012b by recounting certain events of his own time in poetical form, some parts of which are lyrics. His style of lyrical poetry has been described as \u201cpowdered,\u201d and his ghazal s contain many of the elements that in the 16th and 17th centuries were to become characteristic of the \u201cIndian\u201d style. Khosrow\u2019s poetry surprises the reader in its use of unexpected forms and unusual images, complicated constructions and verbal plays, all handled fluently and presented in technically perfect language. His books on the art of letter writing prove his mastery of high-flown Persian prose. Khosrow\u2019s younger contemporary, \u1e24asan of Delhi (died 1328), is less well known and had a more simple style. He nevertheless surpassed Khosrow in warmth and charm, qualities that earned him the title of \u201cthe Sa\u02bfd\u012b of Hindustan.\u201d",
  "As for the literary developments in Turkey about 1300, the mystical singer Yunus Emre is the first and most important in a long line of popular poets. Little is known about his life, which he probably spent not far from the Sakarya River of Asia Minor. Before him, in Central Asia, the religious leader Ahmed Yesevi (died 1166) had written some rather dry verses on wisdom in Turkish. Yunus, in Anatolia, however, was the first known poet to have caught something of R\u016bm\u012b\u2019s fervour and translated it into a provincial setting, creating \u201ca Turkish vernacular poetry that was to be the model for all subsequent literary productions of popular religion.\u201d Sometimes he used the inherited Arabo-Persian prosody, but his best poems are those written in four-line verses using syllable-counting metres. Yunus drew heavily on the reservoir of imagery that had been collected by the great Persian writing mystics, notably R\u016bm\u012b, but his classical technique did not hinder the expression of his own unself-conscious simplicity, which led him to introduce new images taken from everyday life in Anatolian villages. His ilahi s (hymns), probably written to be sung at the meetings of the Sufis in the centres of their orders, are still loved by the Turks and memorized by their children.",
  "The Turkish people rightly claim Yunus as the founder of Turkish literature proper. His poetry is considered the chief pillar of poetry of the Bektashi Sufi order, and many poets of this and other orders have imitated his style (though without reaching the same level of poetic truth and human warmth). Among the later poets claimed by the Bektashis may be mentioned Kaygusuz Abdal (15th century), who probably came from the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire. His verses are full of burlesque and even coarse images; in their odd mixture of worldliness and religious expression, they are often as amusing as they are puzzling. In the 16th century Pir Sultan Abdal (executed c. 1560) is noted for a few poems of austere melancholy. He was executed for collaboration with the Safavids , the archenemies of the Ottomans, and in this connection it is worth remembering that the founder of the Iranian Safavid dynasty, Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl I (died 1524), wrote Turkish poetry under the pen name Kha\u1e6d\u0101\u02be\u012b and is counted among the Bektashi poets.",
  "Mystically tinged poetry has always been very popular in Turkey, both in cities and in rural areas. The best-loved religious poem of all was, and still is, S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi \u2019s (died 1419) Mevl\u00fbd , a quite short mas\u0304nav\u012b in honour of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s birth. This type of poetry has been known in the Islamic countries since at least the 12th century and was soon adopted wherever Islam spread. There are a great number of mevl\u00fbd written in Turkish, but it was S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi\u2019s unpretentious description of the great religious event that captured the hearts of the Turks, and it is still sung on many occasions (on the anniversary of a death, for example). The poem makes an excellent introduction to an understanding of the deep love for the Prophet felt by the pious Muslim.",
  "In the Iran of the Middle Ages, a vast number of poets flourished at the numerous courts. Not only professional poets but even the kings and princes contributed more or less successfully to the body of Persian poetry. Epics, panegyrics, and mystico-didactical poetry had all reached their finest hour by the end of the 13th century; the one genre to attain perfection slightly later was the ghazal , of which Mo\u1e25ammad Shams al-D\u012bn \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93 (died 1389/90) is the incontestable master.",
  " D\u012bv\u0101n  \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93 lived in Sh\u012br\u0101z; his pen name\u2014\u201cWho Knows the Qur\u02be\u0101n by Heart\u201d\u2014indicates his wide religious education, but little is known about the details of his life. The same is true of many Persian lyrical poets, because their products rarely contain much trustworthy biographical material. \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93\u2019s comparatively small collection of work\u2014his D\u012bv\u0101n contains about 400 ghazal s\u2014was soon acclaimed as the finest lyrical poetry ever written in Persian. The discussion of whether or not to interpret its wine and love songs on a mystical plane has continued for centuries. Yet this discussion seems sterile since \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93, whose verbal images shine like jewels, is an outstanding exponent of the ambiguous and oscillating style that makes Persian poetry so attractive and so difficult to translate.",
  "The different levels of experience are all expressed through the same images and symbols: the beloved is always cruel, whether a chaste virgin (a rare case in Persian poetry!), a professional courtesan, a handsome young boy (in most cases), God (mysterious and unattainable), or even the remote despot, the wisdom of whose schemes must never be questioned by his subjects. Because mystical interpretation of the world order had become almost second nature to Persians during the 13th century, the human beloved could effortlessly be regarded as God\u2019s manifestation; the rose became a symbol of highest divine beauty and glory; the nightingale represented the yearning and complaining soul; wine, cup, and cupbearer became the embodiment of enrapturing divine love. The poets\u2019 multicoloured images were not merely decorative embroidery but were a structural part of their thought.",
  "One must not expect \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93 (or any other poet) to unveil his personal feelings in a lyrical poem of experience. But no other Persian poet has used such complex imagery on so many different levels with such harmonious and well-balanced lucidity as did \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93. His true greatness lies in this rather than in the content of his poetry. It must be stressed again that, according to the traditional view, each verse of a ghazal should be unique, precious for its own sake, and that the apparent lack of logic behind the sequence of verses was considered a virtue rather than a defect. (It may help to think of the glass pieces in a kaleidoscope, which appear in different patterns from moment to moment yet themselves form no logical pattern.) To what extent an \u201cinner rhythm\u201d and a \u201ccontrapuntal harmony\u201d can be detected in \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93\u2019s poetry is still a matter for discussion, but that he perfected the ghazal form is indisputable. Whether he is praised as a very human love poet, as an interpreter of esoteric lore, or as a political critic, his verses have a continuing appeal to all lovers of art and artistry.",
  "\u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93\u2019s contemporary in Sh\u012br\u0101z was the satirist \u02bfObeyd-e Z\u0101k\u0101n\u012b (died 1371), noted for his obscene verses (even the most moralistic and mystical poets sometimes produced surprisingly coarse and licentious lines) and for his short mas\u0304nav\u012b called M\u016bsh o-gorbeh (\u201cMouse and Cat\u201d), an amusing political satire. Because few new forms or means of expression were open to them, \u02bfObeyd and other poets began ridiculing the classic models of literature; thus, Bos\u1e25\u0101q (died c. 1426) composed odes and ghazal s exclusively on the subject of food.",
  "The Timurid period in Iran produced only moderately good poetry, despite the rulers\u2019 interest in art. Allegorical mas\u0304nav\u012b s were much in vogue, such as the Shabest\u0101n-e khay\u0101l (\u201cBedchamber of Fantasy\u201d) by the prolific writer Fatt\u0101\u1e25\u012b of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br (died 1448) and G\u016by o-chowg\u0101n (\u201cBall and Polo-stick\u201d) by \u02bf\u0100ref\u012b (died 1449); the latter work is an elaboration of the clich\u00e9 that the lover is helpless before the will of his beloved, just as the ball is subject to the will of the polo-stick (\u201cthe head of the lover in the polo-stick of the beloved\u2019s tresses\u201d).",
  "The last great centre of Islamic art in the region of Iran was the Timurid court of Her\u0101t, where Dowlatsh\u0101h (died 1494) composed his much-quoted biographical work on Persian poets. The leading figure in this circle was \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n J\u0101m\u012b (died 1492), who is sometimes considered the last and most comprehensive of the \u201cseven masters\u201d in Persian literature, because he was a master of every literary genre and did not specialize in one form only, as Anvar\u012b and \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93, among others, had done. J\u0101m\u012b wrote an excellent imitation of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Khamseh , enlarging it by the addition of two mystical mas\u0304nav\u012b s into a septet called Haft owrang (\u201cThe Seven Thrones,\u201d or \u201cThe Constellation of the Great Bear\u201d). His interest in Sufism\u2014he was initiated into the Naqshbandiyyah order\u2014is clear from his famous biographies of the Sufi saints (which were an elaboration of a similar work by the 11th-century \u02bfAbd All\u0101h al-An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b). In imitation of Sa\u02bfd\u012b , J\u0101m\u012b also composed the Bah\u0101rest\u0101n (\u201cOrchard of Spring\u201d), written in prose interspersed with verses. He left no less than three large divans, which contain work of high quality and demonstrate his gift for inventing picturesque images. Although his work abounds in lavishly ornamented verses, his style on the whole lacks the perfect beauty of \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93\u2019s lyrics and is already tending toward the heavier, more opaque \u201cIndian\u201d style. J\u0101m\u012b also wrote treatises about literary riddles and various kinds of intellectual games, of which Muslim society in the late 15th century was very fond and which remain a feature of erudite Persian and Turkish poetry. His influence on the work of later poets, especially in Ottoman Turkey, was powerful.",
  "An interesting aspect of the Timurid court in Her\u0101t was the attention given to Chagatai Turkish, which was spoken in the eastern regions of Islam ( see  Chagatai literature ). \u02bfAl\u012b Sh\u012br Nav\u0101\u02be\u012b , minister at the court (and a close friend of J\u0101m\u012b), emphasized the beauties of his Turkic mother tongue as compared with Persian in his Mu\u1e25\u0101kamat al-lughatayn (\u201cJudgment of the Two Languages\u201d). He composed most of his lyrics and epics in Chagatai, which previously had been used by some members of the Timurid family and their courtiers for poetry but which became, thanks to him, an established literary medium. Even the arts-loving ruler of Her\u0101t, \u1e24usayn Bayqara (died 1506), wrote poetry in Turkic, following in every respect conventional literary taste.",
  "During the first five centuries of literature written in Modern Persian, a multitude of prose works were written. Among them the political instruction tradition known as \u201cmirrors for princes\u201d deserves special mention. This genre, introduced from Persian into Arabic as early as the 8th century, flourished once more in Iran during the late 11th century. One important example is the Q\u0101b\u016bs-n\u0101meh (\u201cThe Book of Q\u0101b\u016bs\u201d) by the Zey\u0101rid prince \u02bfOn\u1e63or ol-Ma\u02bfal\u012b Keyk\u0101v\u016bs (died 1098), which presents \u201ca miscellany of Islamic culture in pre-Mongol times.\u201d At the same time, Ni\u1e93\u0101m al-Mulk (died 1092), the grand vizier of the Seljuqs, composed his Sey\u0101sat-n\u0101meh ( The Book of Government; or, Rules for Kings ), a good introduction to the statesman\u2019s craft according to medieval Islamic standards. The Sey\u0101sat-n\u0101meh was heavily influenced by pre-Islamic Persian tradition. In the same period and environment, even a mystic such as al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b felt disposed to write a Na\u1e63\u012b\u1e25at al-mul\u016bk (\u201cCounsel for Kings\u201d), although the idealized relationship he makes between religious theory and practical statesmanship was not very realistic. A later mystic to compose a similar work was Sayyid \u02bfAl\u012b Hamadh\u0101n\u012b (died 1385), who had settled in Kashmir and initiated its Sufi poetry. Others, especially in India, exhorted rulers in their writings.",
  "Belles lettres proper found a fertile soil in Iran. The fables of Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah , for example, were retold several times in Persian. The most famous version, though a rather turgid one, is called Anv\u0101r-e soheyl\u012b (\u201cLights of Canopus\u201d) and was composed by a famous mystic, \u1e24oseyn W\u0101\u02bfe\u1e93-e K\u0101shef\u012b of Her\u0101t (died 1504). The \u201ccyclic story\u201d form (in which several unconnected tales are held together by some device such as a common framework or narrator), inherited from India, became as popular in Iran as it had been in the Arabic-speaking countries. The Sendb\u0101d-n\u0101meh (\u201cThe Book of Sendb\u0101d [Sindbad]\u201d) and the \u1e6c\u016b\u1e6d\u012b-n\u0101meh (\u201cParrot Book\u201d), which is based on Indian tales, are both good examples of the popular method whereby a variety of instructive stories are skillfully strung together within a basic \u201crunning\u201d story. The first comprehensive collection of entertaining prose is Jaw\u0101m\u012b\u02bf al-\u1e25ikayat (\u201cCollections of Stories\u201d), a veritable storehouse of tales and anecdotes, by \u02bfOwf\u012b (died c. 1230). Anecdotes were an important feature of the biographical literature that became popular in Iran and Muslim India. Biographies of the poets of a certain age or of a specified area were collected together. They provide the reader with few concrete facts about the subjects concerned, but they abound in anecdotes, sayings, and verses attributed to the subjects, thus preserving material that otherwise might have been lost. Many of these biographical manuals, such as \u02bfOwf\u012b\u2019s Lub\u0101b al-alb\u0101b (\u201cQuintessence of the Hearts\u201d) or Dowlatsh\u0101h\u2019s Tazkirat al-shu\u02bfar\u0101\u02be (\u201cBiography of the Poets\u201d), make agreeable reading. The authors concerned wished to demonstrate their own erudition and rhetorical technique as much as to immortalize their subjects; consequently, their books are important equally as stylistic documents and as historical sources. One of the most-remarkable works in this field is Chah\u0101r maq\u0101leh (\u201cFour Treatises\u201d) by Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b-ye \u02bfAr\u016b\u1e95\u012b, a writer from eastern Iran. Written about 1156, this little book is an excellent introduction to the ideals of Persian literature and its writers, discussing in detail what is required to make a perfect poet, giving a number of instances of the sort of poetic craftsmanship thought especially admirable, and allowing glimpses into the various arts in which the literary man was expected to excel.",
  "This tendency toward \u201canecdotal\u201d writing, which is also manifest in the work of a number of Arab historians, can be observed in the cosmographic books and in some of the historical books produced in medieval Iran. The cosmography of \u1e24amdoll\u0101h Mostowf\u012b (died after 1340), Nuzhat al-qul\u016bb (\u201cPleasure of the Hearts\u201d), like many earlier works of this genre, underlined the mysterious aspects of the marvels of creation and was the most famous of several instructive collections of mixed folkloristic and scientific material. Early miniaturists, too, loved to illustrate the most unlikely tales and pieces of information given in such works. Historical writing proper had been begun by the Persians as early as the late 10th century, when Bal\u02bfam\u012b made an abridged translation of the vast Arabic historical chronicle by al-\u1e6cabar\u012b (died 923).",
  "The heyday of historiography in Iran, however, was the Il-Khanid period (mid-13th to mid-14th century). Iran was then ruled by the successors of Genghis (Chinggis) Khan, and scholars began to extend their interest back to the history of pre-Islamic Central Asia, whence the rulers had come. T\u0101r\u012bkh-e jeh\u0101n-gosh\u0101y (\u201cHistory of the World Conqueror\u201d) by \u02bfA\u1e6d\u0101 Malek Joveyn\u012b (died 1283) and J\u0101mi\u02bf al-taw\u0101r\u012bkh (\u201cCollector of Chronicles\u201d) by the physician and vizier Rash\u012bd al-D\u012bn (executed 1318) are both outstanding examples of histories filled with valuable information. Although the writing of history became a firmly established art in Iran and the adjacent Muslim countries, the facts were unfortunately all too often concealed in a bombastic style and a labyrinth of cumbersome long-winded sentences. A history written by Va\u1e63\u1e63\u0101f (died 1323) is the most notorious example of turgidity, but even his style was surpassed by some later writers. These stylistic tendencies deeply influenced Turkish prose writing: 17th-century Turkish historical works, such as those of Pe\u00e7evi (died c. 1650) and Naima (died 1716), for this reason almost defy translation. Later Persian prose in India suffered from the same defects. This development in Persian and Turkish prose is also reflected in the handbooks on style and letter writing that were written during the 14th and 15th centuries and afterward. They urged the practice of all the artificial tricks of rhetoric by this time considered essential for an elegant piece of prose.",
  "Islamic literatures should not be thought to consist only of erudite and witty court poetry, of frivolous or melancholy love lyrics full of literary conceits, or of works deeply mystical in content. Such works are counterbalanced by a great quantity of popular literature, of which the most famous expression is Alf laylah wa laylah ( The Thousand and One Nights , also known as The Arabian Nights\u2019 Entertainment ). The tales collected under this title come from different cultural areas; their nucleus is of Indian origin, first translated into Persian as Haz\u0101r afs\u0101nak (\u201cThousand Tales\u201d) and then into Arabic. These fanciful fairy tales were later expanded with stories and anecdotes from Baghdad. Subsequently some tales\u2014mainly from the lower strata of society\u2014about rogues, tricksters, and vagabonds were added in Egypt. Independent series of stories, such as that of Sindbad the Sailor , were also included. The entire collection is very important as a reflection of several aspects of Middle Eastern folklore and allows, now and then, glimpses into the court life of the various dynasties. Since its first translation into French (1704) and for the better part of three centuries, it fed a romantic notion in the West regarding the Middle East.",
  "From pre-Islamic times the Arabs had recounted tales of the ayy\u0101m al-\u02bfArab (\u201cDays of the Arabs\u201d), which were stories of their tribal wars, and had dwelt upon tales of the heroic deeds of certain of their brave warriors, such as \u02bfAntarah. Modern research, however, suggests that his story in its present setting belongs to the period of the Crusades. The Egyptian queen Shajar al-Durr (died 1250) and the first brave Mamluk ruler, Baybars I (died 1277), as well as the adventures of the Bedouin tribe Ban\u016b Hil\u0101l on its way to Tunisia, are all the subjects of lengthy popular tales.",
  "In Iran many of the historical legends and myths had been borrowed and turned into high literature by Ferdows\u012b . Accounts of the glorious adventures of heroes from early Islamic times were afterward retold throughout Iran, India, and Turkey. Thus, the D\u0101st\u0101n-e Am\u012br \u1e24amzeh , a story of Muhammad\u2019s uncle \u1e24amzah ibn \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, was slowly enlarged by the addition of more and more fantastic details. This form of d\u0101st\u0101n , as such literature is called, to some extent influenced the first attempts at novel writing in Muslim India during the 19th century. The epics of K\u00f6ro\u011flu are common to both Iranian and Turkish tradition. He was a noble warrior-robber who became one of the central figures in folk literature from Central Asia to Anatolia.",
  "Some popular epics were composed in the late Middle Ages and were based on local traditions. One such epic had as its basis the Turco-Iranian legend of an 8th-century hero, Ab\u016b Muslim , another the Turkish tales of the knight D\u0101nishmend. Other epics, such as the traditional Turkish tale of Dede Korkut, were preserved by storytellers who improvised certain parts of their tales (which were written down only afterward). Also, the role of the Sufi orders and of the artisans\u2019 lodges in preserving and transmitting such semihistorical popular epics seems to have been considerable. Apart from heroic figures, the Muslim peoples further share a comic character\u2014basically a type of low-class theologian, called Nasreddin Hoca in Turkish, Ju\u1e25\u0101 in Arabic, and Mushfiq\u012b in Tajik. Anecdotes about this character, which embody the mixture of silliness and shrewdness displayed by this \u201ctype,\u201d have amused generations of Muslims.",
  "Shortly after the introduction of the printing press, Turkey and Iran began to produce cheap books, sometimes illustrated, containing popular romantic love stories. Large numbers of fairy tales were published in these cheap editions, and still other fairy tales were collected by European and Muslim folklorists.",
  "A truly popular poetry is everywhere to be found: lullabies sung by mothers around the world have obvious similarities; workers sing little rhythmical poems to accompany their work; and nomads remember the adventures of their ancestors in their ballads. Such popular poems often contain dialect forms, and the metres differ from the classical quantitative system. Some of these simple verses, such as a two-line lan\u1e0day in Pashto , are among the most graceful products of Islamic poetry. Many folk songs\u2014lullabies, wedding songs, and dirges\u2014have a distinct mystical flavour and reflect the simple Muslim\u2019s love for the Prophet and trust in God\u2019s grace even under the most difficult circumstances. Irony and wit are features of the riddle poem, a favourite form among Muslims everywhere. Folk poets were also fond of humorous descriptions of imaginary disputes between two entities\u2014they might compose dialogues between coffee and tobacco (Morocco), between a big and a small mosque (Yemen), between a cat and a dog, or between a boy and a girl. All the Iranian and Turkic languages, too, possess a rich heritage of popular poetry, which in many cases appeals more immediately to modern tastes than does the rather cerebral high literature of the urban and court cultures.",
  "According to Persian tradition, the last classic author in literature was J\u0101m\u012b, who died in 1492. In that year Christopher Columbus set off on his first transatlantic voyage, and the Christians conquered Granada , the last Moorish stronghold of Spain, at the close of the Reconquista. The beginning of the 16th century was as crucial in the history of the Muslim East as in the history of the Western Hemisphere. In 1501 the young Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl founded the Safavid rule in Iran, and the Shi\u02bfi persuasion of Islam was declared the state religion. At the same time, the kingdoms of the last Timurid rulers in Central Asia were overthrown by the Uzbeks , who, for a while, tried to continue the cultural tradition in both Persian and Turkic at their courts in Bukhara . In 1526, after long struggles, one member of the Timurid house, B\u0101bur , laid the foundation of the Mughal Empire in India. In the Middle East the Ottoman Turks, having expanded their empire (beginning in the late 13th century) from northwestern Anatolia into the Balkans, conquered crumbling Mamluk Egypt and adjacent countries, including the sacred places of Mecca and Medina in 1516\u201317. Thus, three main blocks emerged, and the two strongholds of Sunni Islam\u2014Ottoman Turkey and Mughal India\u2014were separated by Shi\u02bfi Iran.",
  "Safavid Iran, as it happened, lost most of its artists and poets to the neighbouring countries. There were no great masters of poetry in Iran between the 16th and 18th centuries. And while the Persian shah Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl I wrote Turkish mystical verses, his contemporary and enemy, Sultan Selim I of Turkey (died 1520), composed quite elegant Persian ghazal s. B\u0101bur (died 1530), in turn, composed his autobiography in Eastern Turkic.",
  "B\u0101bur\u2019s autobiography is a fascinating piece of Chagatai Turkish prose and at the same time one of the comparatively rare examples of Islamic autobiographical literature. The classic example in this genre, however, was a lively Arabic autobiography by Us\u0101mah ibn Munqidh (died 1188), which sheds much light upon the life and cultural background of a Syrian knight during the Crusades . A number of mystics, too, had written their spiritual autobiographies in a variety of languages, with varying degrees of artistic success. B\u0101bur\u2019s book, however, gives a wonderful insight into the character of this intrepid conqueror. It reveals him as a master of concise matter-of-fact prose, as a keen observer of daily life, full of pragmatic common sense, and also as a good judge of poetry. B\u0101bur even went so far as to write a treatise in Chagatai Turkish about versification. Many of his descendants, both male and female, inherited his literary taste and talent for poetry; among them are remarkably good poets in Persian, Chagatai Turkish, and Urdu, as well as accomplished authors of autobiographies ( Jah\u0101ng\u012br ) and letters ( Aurangzeb ). Among the nobility of India, the Chagatai Turkish language remained in use until the 19th century. Lovely Chagatai Turkish verses were written, for example, by Akbar\u2019s general, \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm Kh\u0101n-e Kh\u0101n\u0101n (died 1626), who was a great patron of fine arts and poetry.",
  "In the Arab world there was hardly a poet or original writer of note during the three centuries that followed the Ottoman conquest, apart from some theologians (\u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b al-Sha\u02bfr\u0101n\u012b, died 1565; \u02bfAbd al-Ghan\u012b al-N\u0101bulus\u012b, died 1731) and grammarians. Yet Arabic still remained the language of theology and scholarship throughout the Muslim world; both Turkey and India could boast a large number of scholars who excelled in the sacred language. In Ottoman Turkey, Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fczade (died 1560) compiled a historical survey of outstanding Turkish intellectuals in Arabic. Although a fine example of Islamic learning, in usefulness it does not compare to the bibliographic work in Arabic by Hac\u0131 Halifa (K\u00e2tip \u00c7elebi; died 1658), which is a valuable source for modern knowledge of literary history.",
  "India\u2019s share in the development of Arabic literature at this time was especially large. In addition to the quantity of theological work written in the language of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, from the conquest of Sindh (in present-day Pakistan) in 711 right up until the 19th century, much philosophical and biographical literature in Arabic was also being written in the subcontinent. Persian taste predominated in the northwest of India, but in the southern provinces there were long-standing commercial and cultural relationships with the Arabs, especially in Yemen and \u1e24a\u1e0dramawt , and an inclination toward preserving these intact. Thus, much poetry in conventional Arabic style was written during the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in the kingdom of Golconda . There are even attempts at the epic form. A century after the heyday of Arabic in the Deccan , \u0100z\u0101d Bilgrami (died 1786) composed numerous poetical and biographical works in Persian, but his chief fame was as the \u201c\u1e24ass\u0101n of Hind,\u201d since he, like the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u1e24ass\u0101n ibn Th\u0101bit , wrote some powerful Arabic panegyrics in honour of the Prophet. He even attempted to make a comparison of the characteristics of Arabic and Sanskrit poetry and tried to prove that India was the real homeland of Islam. It should be added that al-Sayyid Murta\u1e0d\u0101 al-Zab\u012bd (died 1791), a leading philologist, author of the fundamental work of lexicography T\u0101j al-\u02bfar\u016bs (\u201cThe Bride\u2019s Crown\u201d), and commentator on Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s main work, was of Indian origin. Laudatory poems and belles lettres in Arabic were still popular in the early 19th century at the Shi\u02bfi court of Lucknow, then the chief centre of Urdu poetry.",
  "Nevertheless, the main contribution of Muslim India to high literature was made in the Persian tongue. Persian had been the official language of the country for many centuries. The numerous annals and chronicles that were compiled during the 14th and 15th centuries, as well as the court poetry, had been composed exclusively in this language even by Hindus. During the Mughal period its importance was enhanced both by Akbar \u2019s attempt to have the main works of classical Sanskrit literature translated into Persian and by the constant influx of poets from Iran who came seeking their fortune at the lavish tables of the Indian Muslim grandees. At this time what is known as the \u201cIndian\u201d style of Persian emerged. The translations from Sanskrit enriched the Persian vocabulary, and new stories of Indian origin added to the reservoir of classical imagery. The poets, bound to the inherited genres of mas\u0304nav\u012b , qa\u1e63\u012bdah , and ghazal , tried to outdo each other in the use of complex rhyme patterns and unfamiliar, often stiff, metres. It became fashionable to conceive a poem according to a given zam\u012bn (\u201cground\u201d), in emulation of a classical model, and then to enrich it with newly invented tropes. The long-held ideal of \u201charmonious selection of images\u201d was not always met. Difficult, even awkward grammatical constructions and inverted metaphors can be found. At times, pseudo-philosophical utterances in the second hemistich of a verse contrast strangely with semicolloquial expressions elsewhere. Objects recently introduced to India, such as the eyeglass or hourglass, were eagerly adopted as images by the poets, who wanted newfangled conceits to bolster their tortuous inventiveness. Notwithstanding the colourful descriptive poems written in praise of such subjects as Mughal palaces, marvelously illuminated manuscripts, rare elephants, or court scenes, the general mood of lyric poetry became more gloomy. The transitory nature of the world, also a central theme in classical Persian poetry, was stressed and depicted in bizarre images: \u201cburnt nest,\u201d \u201cbreakdown,\u201d \u201cyawning\u201d (indicating insatiable thirst); these were some of the new \u201cstylish\u201d words.",
  "Yet some truly great poets are to be found even in this period. \u02bfUrf\u012b, who left Sh\u012br\u0101z for India and died in his mid-30s in Lahore (1592), is without doubt one of the few genuine masters of Persian poetry, especially in his qa\u1e63\u012bdah s. His verses pile up linguistic difficulties, yet their dark, glowing quality cannot fail to touch the hearts and minds even of critical modern readers\u2014more so than the elegant but rather cerebral verses of his colleague Fayz\u012b (died 1595), one of Akbar\u2019s favourites. Fayz\u012b\u2019s brother Ab\u016b al-Fa\u1e0dl \u02bfAll\u0101m\u012b (died 1602), the author of an important, though biased, historical work, deeply influenced the emperor\u2019s religious ideas. Among 17th-century Mughal court poets, the most outstanding is Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib Kal\u012bm (died 1651), who came from Hamadan. Abounding in descriptive passages of great virtuosity, his poignant and often pessimistic verses have become proverbial, thanks to their compact diction and fluent style. Also of some importance is \u1e62\u0101\u02beib of Tabriz (died 1677), who spent only a few years in India before returning to Iran. Yet, of his immense poetical output (300,000 couplets), the great majority belongs to the stock-in-trade expression of the Persian-speaking world. Other poets described the lives and adventures of members of the royal families, usually in verbose mas\u0304nav\u012b s (this kind of descriptive historical poetry was practiced throughout Muslim India and also in Ottoman Turkey). Outside the Mughal environment, the lyrics and mas\u0304nav\u012b s by \u1e92uh\u016br\u012b (died 1615) at the court of Bij\u0101pur are charming and enjoyable.",
  "The heir apparent of the Mughal Empire, D\u0101r\u0101 Shik\u014dh (executed 1659), also followed Akbar\u2019s path. His inclination to mysticism is reflected in both his prose and poetry. The Persian translation of the Upanishad s, which he sponsored (and in part wrote himself), enriched Persian religious prose and made a deep impression on European idealistic philosophy in the 19th century. A group of interesting poets gathered about him, none of them acceptable to orthodoxy. They included the convert Persian Jew Sarmad (executed 1661), author of mystical rob\u0101\u02bfiyy\u0101t , and the Hindu Brahman (died 1662), whose prose work Chah\u0101r chaman (\u201cFour Meadows\u201d) gives an interesting insight into life at court.",
  "With the long rule of D\u0101r\u0101 Shik\u014dh\u2019s brother, the austere Aurangzeb (died 1707), the heyday of both poetry and historical writing in Muslim India was over. Once more, orthodox religious literature gained preeminence, while poets tried to escape into a fantasy world of dreams. The style of the two leading poets of this age, N\u0101\u1e63ir \u02bfAl\u012b Sirhind\u012b (died 1697) and M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0113dil (died 1721), is convoluted and obscure, prompting the Persian poet \u1e24az\u012bn (died 1766), who went to India in the early 18th century, to write ironic comments about its incomprehensibility. B\u0113dil, however, was a very interesting writer. His lyric poetry is difficult but often rewarding, while his many philosophical mas\u0304nav\u012b s deserve deep study. His prose work, interspersed with poetry, is called Chah\u0101r \u02bfun\u1e63ur (\u201cFour Elements\u201d) and contains some biographical details. His prose is nearly as difficult as his poetry, and, consequently, his works rarely have been read outside of India. His poetry, however, has had a great influence in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Many Persian-speaking people there consider him the forerunner of Tajik literature, because virtually everyone in Bukhara and Transoxania who tried to write poetry followed B\u0113dil\u2019s example. His ideas, sometimes astoundingly modern and progressive, also impressed the 20th-century poet and philosopher Mu\u1e25ammad Iqb\u0101l in what is now Pakistan.",
  "With B\u0113dil the \u201cIndian summer\u201d of Persian literature came to an end, even though the output of Persian poetry and prose during the 18th century in the subcontinent was immense. Some of the biographical dictionaries and handbooks of mysticism are valuable for the scholar but are less interesting as part of the general history of literature. The main vehicle of poetry became the Urdu language , while mystical poetry flourished in Sindhi and Punjabi .",
  "From the borderlands of the Persian-speaking zone, culturally under Mughal rule, one poet deserves special attention. The chief of the Pashtun tribe of Kha\u1e6dak, Khush\u1e25\u0101l Kh\u0101n (died 1689), rightly deserves to be called the father of Pashto poetry, for he virtually created a literature of his own in his mother tongue. His skill in translating the sophisticated traditions of Persian literature into the not too highly developed idiom of the Pashtuns is astonishing. His lively lyric poems are his finest works, reflecting that passionate love of freedom for which he fought against the Mughals. The poems he wrote from prison in \u201chell-like hot India\u201d are as dramatic as they are touching in their directness. Many members of his family took to poetry, and during the 18th century original works, both religious and secular, were composed in Pashto, and the classics of Persian literature were translated into that language.",
  "The development of literature in Ottoman Turkey is almost parallel with that of Iran and India. Yunus Emre had introduced a popular form of mystical poetry, yet the mainstream of secular and religious literature followed Persian models (although it took some time to establish the Persian rules of prosody, because of the entirely different structure of the Turkish language). In the religious field, the vigour and boldness expressed in the poems of Seyyid \u02bfIm\u0101d al-D\u012bn Nes\u012bm\u012b (executed c. 1418) left their traces in the work of later poets, none of whom, however, reached his loftiness and grandeur of expression. The 14th- and 15th-century representatives of the classical style displayed great charm in their literary compositions, their verses simple and pleasing. Sultan Cem (Jem; died 1495), son of Mehmed the Conqueror, is an outstanding representative of their number. But soon the high-flown style of post-classical Persian was being imitated by Ottoman authors, rhetoric often being more important to them than poetical content. The work of B\u00e2k\u00ee (B\u0101q\u012b; died 1600) is representative of the entire range of those baroque products. Yet his breathtaking command of language is undeniable; it is brilliantly displayed in his elegy on S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent . In his time, according to a popular saying, one could find \u201ca poet under every stone of Istanbul\u2019s pavement.\u201d Istanbul was the unique cultural centre of the Middle East, praised throughout the ages by all who lived in the imperial city.",
  "Much greater than most of these minor poets, however, was a writer living outside the capital, Fuzuli of Baghdad (died 1556), who wrote in Arabic, Persian, and Azeri Turkish. Apart from his lyrics, his Turkish mas\u0304nav\u012b on the traditional subject of the lovers Majn\u016bn and Layl\u0101 is admirable. From earliest times, Turkish poets had emulated the classical Persian romantic mas\u0304nav\u012b s, sometimes surpassing their models in expressiveness. Fuzuli\u2019s diction is taut, his command of imagery masterful. His style unfortunately defies poetical translation, and his complicated fabric of plain and inverted images, of hidden and overt allusions, is well-nigh impossible for all but the initiated Muslim reader to disentangle. Fuzuli, moreover, like his fellow poets, would blend Arabic, Persian, and Azeri Turkish constructions and words to make up a multifaceted unit. The same difficulty is found in Turkish prose literature of the same period. It is a major task to unravel the long trailing sentences of a writer such as Evliya \u00c7elebi (died c. 1684), who, in an account of his travels ( Seyahatname ), has left extremely valuable information about the cultural climate in different parts of the Ottoman Empire.",
  "Growing interest in the Indo-Persian style, particularly in \u02bfUrf\u012b\u2019s qa\u1e63\u012bdah s, led the 17th-century Ottoman poets to a new integrated style and precision of diction. An outstanding representative was Nef\u02bei , whose bent for merciless satire made him dreaded in the capital and eventually led to his assassination. At the start of the 18th century, a marked but short-lived movement in Turkish art known as the \u201cTulip Period\u201d was the Ottoman counterpart of European Rococo. The musical poems and smooth ghazal s of Ahmed Nedim (died 1730) reflect the manners and style of the slightly decadent, relaxed, and at times licentious high society of Istanbul and complement the miniatures of his contemporary Abd\u00fclcelil Levn\u00ee (died 1732). Good Turkish poetry is characterized by an easy grace, to be found even in such mystically tinged poems (thousands of which were written throughout the centuries) as those of Niyaz\u00ee Misr\u00ee (died 1697). The Mevlev\u00ee (Mawlaw\u012b) poet G\u00e2lib Dede (died 1799) was already standing at the threshold of what can now be recognized as modern poetical expression in some of the lyrical parts of his mas\u0304nav\u012b , called H\u00fcsn \u00fc a\u015fk (\u201cBeauty and Love\u201d), which brought fresh treatment to a well-worn subject of Iran\u2019s philosophical and secular literature. His work cannot be properly understood, however, without a thorough knowledge of mystical psychology, expressed in multivalent images.",
  "One branch of literature, however, was totally neglected by the sophisticated inhabitants of the Ottoman capital. Nobody thought much of the folk poets who wandered through the forgotten villages of Anatolia singing in simple syllable-counting verses of love, longing, and separation. The poems of the mid-17th-century figure Karacao\u011flan, one of the few historically datable folk poets, give a vivid picture of village life, of the plight of girls and boys in remote Anatolian settlements. This kind of poetry was rediscovered only after the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923 and then became an important influence on modern lyric poetry.",
  "For the Islamic countries, the 19th century marks the beginning of a new epoch. Napoleon \u2019s conquest of Egypt, as well as British colonialism, brought the Muslims into contact with a world whose technology was far in advance of their own. The West had experienced the Renaissance , the Reformation , and the Enlightenment , whereas the once-flourishing Muslim civilization had for a long while been at a near stagnation point despite its remarkable artistic achievements. The introduction of Muslim intellectuals to Western literature and scholarship\u2014the Egyptian al-\u1e6cah\u1e6d\u0101w\u012b (died 1873), for example, studied in France\u2014ushered in a new literary era the chief characteristic of which was to be \u201cmore matter, less art.\u201d The literatures from this time onward are far less \u201cIslamic\u201d than those of the previous 1,000 years, but new intellectual experiences also led to \u201cthe liberation of the whole creative impulse within the Islamic peoples\u201d (James Kritzeck). The introduction of the printing press and the expansion of newspapers helped to shape a new literary style, more in line with the requirements of modern times, when, as one scholar put it, \u201cthe patron prince has been replaced by a middle-class reading public.\u201d",
  "Translations from Western languages provided writers with the model examples of genres previously unknown to them, including the novel , the short story , and dramatic literature . Of those authors whose books were translated, Guy de Maupassant , Sir Walter Scott , and Anton Chekhov were most influential in the development of the novel and the novella . Important also was the ideological platform derived from Leo Tolstoy , whose criticism of Western Christianity was gratefully adopted by writers from Egypt to Muslim India. Western influences can further be observed in the gradual discarding of the time-hallowed static (and turgid) style of both poetry and prose, in the tendency toward simplification of diction, and in the adaptation of syntax and vocabulary to meet the technical demands of emulating Western models.",
  "Contact with the West also encouraged a tendency toward retrospection. Writers concentrated their attention on their own country and particular heritage, such as the \u201cpharaonic myth\u201d of Egypt, the Indo-European roots of Iran, and the Central Asian past of Turkey. In short, there was an emphasis on differentiation, inevitably leading to the rise of nationalism, instead of an emphasis on the unifying spirit and heritage of Islam.",
  "Characteristically, therefore, given this situation, the heralds of Arab nationalism (as reflected in literature) were Christians. The historical novels of Jurj\u012b Zayd\u0101n (died 1914), a Lebanese living in Egypt, made a deep impression on younger writers by glorifying the lionhearted national heroes of past times. Henceforth, the historical novel was to be a favourite genre in all Islamic countries, including Muslim India. The inherited tradition of the heroic or romantic epic and folktale was blended with novelistic techniques learned from Sir Walter Scott . Two writers in the front rank of Arab intellectuals were Am\u012br Shak\u012bb Arsl\u0101n (died 1946), of Druze origin, and Mu\u1e25ammad Kurd \u02bfAl\u012b (died 1953), the founder of the Arab Academy of Damascus, each of whom, by encouraging a new degree of awareness, made an important contribution to the education of modern historians and persons of letters. An inclination toward Romanticism can be detected in prose writing but not, surprisingly, in poetry; thus, the Egyptian Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Lu\u1e6df\u012b al-Manfal\u016b\u1e6d\u012b (died 1924) poured out his feelings in a number of novels that touch on Islamic as well as national issues.",
  "It is fair to say of this transition period that the poetry being written was not as interesting as the prose. The qa\u1e63\u012bdah s of the \u201cPrince of Poets,\u201d A\u1e25mad Shawq\u012b (died 1932), are for the most part ornate imitations of classical models. Even the \u201cPoet of the Nile,\u201d \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (died 1932), who was more interested in the real problems of the day, was nonetheless content to follow conventional patterns. In his poems, Khal\u012bl Mu\u1e6dr\u0101n (died 1949) attempted to achieve a unity of structure hitherto almost unknown, and he also adopted a more subjective approach to expressive lyricism. Thus, he can be said to have inaugurated an era of \u201cRomantic\u201d poetry, staunchly defended by those writers and scholars who had come under English rather than French influence. These included the poet and essayist Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-M\u0101zin\u012b (died 1949) and the prolific writer of poetry and prose \u02bfAbb\u0101s Ma\u1e25m\u016bd al-\u02bfAqq\u0101d (died 1964).",
  "A major contribution to the development of modern prose in the Arabic language was made by a number of writers born between 1889 and 1902. One of them, the \u201chumanist\u201d Taha Hussein , became well known in the West as a literary critic who attacked the historical authenticity of pre-Islamic poetry and stressed the importance of Greek and Latin for the literatures of the modern Middle East. He was also the author of a successful novel called The Tree of Misery , but his best creative writing is in his fictionalized autobiography, Al-Ayy\u0101m (1929\u201367; The Days ), the three parts of which describe in simple language the life of a blind Egyptian village boy. Taha Hussein\u2019s generation became more and more absorbed by the problems of the middle classes (to which most of them belonged), and this led them to realism in fiction. Some turned to fierce social criticism, depicting in their writings the dark side of everyday life in Egypt and elsewhere. The leading writer of this group was Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Taym\u016br, who wrote short stories, a genre developed in Arabic by a Lebanese Christian who settled in the United States, the noted and versatile poet Khalil Gibran (died 1931). Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usayn Haykal (died 1956), a leading figure of Egyptian cultural and political life and the author of numerous historical studies, touched on the difficulties of Egyptian villagers for the first time, in his novel Zaynab (1913). This subject became fashionable quickly afterward, although not all the writers had firsthand knowledge of the feelings and problems of the fellahin. The most fertile author of this group was al-\u02bfAqq\u0101d, who tirelessly produced biographies , literary criticism , and romantic poetry . The Islamic reform movement led by Mu\u1e25ammad \u02bfAbduh (died 1905) and his disciples, which centred on the journal Al-Man\u0101r (\u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d), influenced Arabic prose style across the 20th century and was important in shaping the religious outlook of many authors writing in the 1920s and \u201930s.",
  "A considerable amount of Arabic literature was produced during the 20th century by numerous writers who settled in non-Islamic countries, especially in the United States and Brazil. Most of these writers came from Christian Lebanese families. A feeling of nostalgia often led them to form literary circles or launch magazines or newspapers. (The Arabic-language newspaper Al-Hud\u0101 [or Al-Hoda , \u201cThe Guidance\u201d], established in 1898, was published in New York City as Al-Hud\u0101 al-jad\u012bdah [ Al-Hoda Aljadidah ; \u201cThe New Al-Hoda,\u201d or \u201cThe New Guidance\u201d].) It was largely because of their work that the techniques of modern fiction and modern free verse entered Arabic literature and became a decisive factor in it.",
  "One of the best-known authors in this group was Ameen Rihani (died 1941), whose descriptions of his journeys through the Arab world are informative and make agreeable reading. The fact that so many Lebanese emigrated led to the creation of a standard theme in Lebanese fiction: emigrants returning to their villages. Modern Iraqi literature is best represented by \u201cthe poet of freedom\u201d Ma\u02bfr\u016bf al-Ru\u1e63\u0101f\u012b (died 1945), and Jam\u012bl Sidq\u012b al-Zah\u0101w\u012b (died 1936), whose satire \u201cThawrah f\u012b al-Ja\u1e25\u012bm\u201d (\u201cRebellion in Hell\u201d) incurred the wrath of the traditionalists.",
  "The same changing attitude toward the function of literature and the same shift toward realism can be observed in Turkey. After 1839, Western ideas and forms were taken up by a group of modernists. Ziya Pa\u015fa (died 1880), the translator of Jean-Jacques Rousseau \u2019s \u00c9mile (which became a popular textbook for 19th-century Muslim intellectuals), was among the first to write in a less traditional idiom and to complain in his poetry\u2014just as \u1e24\u0101l\u012b was to do in India a few years later\u2014about the pitiable conditions of Muslims under the victorious Christians. Ziya Pa\u015fa, together with \u0130brahim \u015einasi (died 1871) and Nam\u0131k Kemal (died 1888), founded an influential Turkish journal, Tasvir-i Efk\u00e2r (\u201cPicture of Ideas\u201d). The essential theme of the articles, novels, poems, and dramas composed by these authors is their fatherland ( vatan ), and they dared to advocate freedom of thought, democracy, and constitutionalism. Abd\u00fclhak H\u00e2mid (died 1935), though considerably their junior, shared in their activities. In 1879 he published his epoch-making Sahra (\u201cThe Country\u201d), a collection of 10 Turkish poems that were the first to be composed in Western verse forms and style. Later he turned to unusual and often morbid subject matter in his poetic dramas. He, like his colleagues, had to endure political restrictions on writing, imposed as part of the harsh measures taken by Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II against the least sign of liberal thought. Influenced by his work, later writers aimed to simplify literary language: Ziya G\u00f6kalp (died 1924) laid the philosophical foundations of Turkish nationalism; and Mehmed Emin, a fisherman\u2019s son, sang artless Turkish verses of his pride in being a Turk, throwing out the heavy rhetorical ballast of Arabo-Persian prosody and instead turning to the language of the people, unadulterated by any foreign vocabulary. The stirrings of social criticism could be discerned after 1907. Mehmed Akif (died 1936), in his masterly narrative poems, gave a vivid critical picture of conditions in Turkey before World War I. His powerful and dramatic style, though still expressed in traditional metres, is a testimony to his deep concern for the people\u2019s sorrows. It was he who composed the Turkish national anthem after Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk \u2019s victory, but soon afterward he left the country, disappointed with the religious policies of the Kemalists.",
  "Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s struggle for freedom also marks the real beginning of modern Turkish literature. The mainstream of novels, stories, and poems written during the 19th century had been replete with tears, world-weariness, and pessimism, but a postwar novel, Ate\u015ften g\u00f6mlek (\u201cThe Fire Shirt\u201d), written by a woman, Halide Edib Ad\u0131var (died 1964), reflected the brave new self-awareness of the Turkish nation. Some successful short stories about village life came from the pen of \u00d6mer Seyfeddin (died 1920). The most-gifted interpreter and harshest critic of Turkey\u2019s social structure was Sabahattin Ali, who was murdered during a flight to Bulgaria in 1948. His major theme was the tragedy of the lower classes, and his writing is characterized by the same merciless realism that was later to be a feature of stories by many left-wing writers throughout the Islamic world. The \u201cgreat old man of Turkish prose,\u201d Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu (died 1974), displayed profound psychological insight, whether ironically describing the lascivious life in a Bektashi (Muslim mystic order) centre or a stranger\u2019s tragedy in an Anatolian village. Most of the Turkish novelists of the 1920s and \u201930s concentrated on the problems of becoming a modern nation, and in particular they reinterpreted the role of women in a liberated society.",
  "Literary energies were set completely free when Atat\u00fcrk introduced the Latin alphabet in 1928, hoping that his people would forget their Islamic past along with the Arabic letters. From this time onward, especially after the language reform that was meant to rediscover the pre-Islamic roots of the Turkish language, Turkish literature followed the pattern of Western literature in all major respects, though with local overtones. Poets experimented with new forms and new topics. They discovered the significance of the Anatolian village, neglected\u2014even forgotten\u2014during the Ottoman period. Freeing themselves from the traditional rules of Persian poetry, they adopted simpler forms from Europe. In some cases the skillful blending of inherited Ottoman grace and borrowed French lyricism produced outstandingly beautiful poems, such as those of Ahmed Ha\u015fim (died 1933) and of Yahya Kemal Beyatl\u0131 (died 1958), in which the twilight world of old Istanbul is mirrored in soft evocative hues and melodious words. At the same time, the figure of Naz\u0131m Hikmet (died 1963) looms large in Turkish poetry. Expressing his progressive social attitude in truly poetical form, he used free rhythmical patterns quite brilliantly to enrapture his readers. His style, as well as his powerful, unforgettable images, has deeply influenced not only Turkish verse but also progressive Urdu and Persian poetry from the 1930s onward.",
  "In Iran the situation resembled that in Turkey to a certain extent. While the last \u201cclassical\u201d poet, Q\u0101\u02be\u0101n\u012b (died 1854), had been displaying the traditional glamorous artistry, his contemporary, the satirist Yaghm\u0101 (died 1859), had been using popular and comprehensible language to make coarse criticisms of contemporary society. As in the other Islamic countries, a move toward simplicity is discernible during the last decades of the 19th century. The members of the polytechnic college D\u0101r ol-Fon\u016bn (founded 1851), led by its erudite principal Re\u1e95\u0101 Qol\u012b Kh\u0101n Hed\u0101yat, helped to shape the \u201cnew\u201d style by making translations from European languages. N\u0101\u1e63er al-D\u012bn Sh\u0101h described his journeys to Europe in the late 1870s in a simple, unassuming style and in so doing set an example for future prose writers.",
  "At the turn of the century, literature became for many younger writers an instrument of modernization and of revolution in the largest sense of the word. No longer did they want to complain, in inherited fixed forms, of some boy whose face was like the moon. Instead, the feelings and situation of women were stated and interpreted. Their oppression, their problems, and their grievances are a major theme of literature in this transition period of the first decades of the 20th century. The \u201cKing of Poets,\u201d Mu\u1e25ammad Taq\u012b Bah\u0101r (died 1951), who had been actively working before World War I for democracy, now devoted himself to a variety of cultural activities, but his poems, though highly classical in form, were of great influence; they dealt with contemporary events and appealed to a wide public.",
  "One branch of modern Persian literature is closely connected with a group of Persian authors who lived in Berlin after World War I. There they established the Kaviani Press (named after a mythical blacksmith called Kaveh, who had saved the Iranian kingdom), and among the poems they printed were several by \u02bf\u0100ref Qazv\u012bn\u012b (died 1934), one of the first truly modern writers. They also published the first short stories of Muhammad \u02bfAli Jamalzadah (died 1997), whose outspoken social criticism and complete break with the traditional inflated and pompous prose style inaugurated a new era of modern Persian prose. Many young writers adopted this new form, among them Sadeq Hedayat (died 1951), whose stories\u2014written entirely in a direct everyday language with a purity of expression that was an artistic achievement\u2014have been translated into many languages. They reflect the sufferings of living individuals; instead of dealing in literary clich\u00e9s, they describe the distress and anxiety of a hopeless youth. The influence of Franz Kafka (some of whose work Hedayat translated) is perceptible in his writing, and he has a tendency toward psychological probing shared by many Persian writers.",
  "As in neighbouring countries, women played a considerable role in the development of modern Persian literature. The lyrics of Parv\u012bn E\u02bfte\u1e63\u0101m\u012b (died 1940) are regarded as near classics, despite a trace of sentimentality in their sympathetic treatment of the poor. Some Persian writers whose left-wing political ideas brought them into conflict with the government left for what is now Tajikistan. Of these, the gifted poet Ab\u016b al-Q\u0101sim L\u0101h\u016bt\u012b (died 1957) is their most important representative.",
  "Persian literature in the Indian subcontinent did not have such importance as in earlier centuries, for English replaced Persian as the official language in 1835. Nevertheless, there were some outstanding poets who excelled in Urdu. One of them was M\u012brz\u0101 Asadull\u0101h Kh\u0101n Gh\u0101lib (died 1869), the undisputed master of Urdu lyrics. He regarded himself, however, as the leading authority on high Persian style and was an accomplished writer of Persian prose and poetry. But much more important was a later poet, Sir Mu\u1e25ammad Iqb\u0101l (died 1938), who chose Persian to convey his message not only to the peoples of Muslim India but also to Afghans and Persians. Reinterpreting many of the old mystical ideas in the light of modern teachings, he taught the quiescent Muslim peoples self-awareness, urging them to develop their personalities to achieve true individualism. His first  mas\u0304nav\u012b  , called \u201cAsr\u0101r-e khud\u012b\u201d (1915; \u201cSecrets of the Self\u201d), deeply shocked all those who enjoyed the dreamlike sweetness of most traditional Persian poetry. One of his later Persian works, Pay\u0101m-e Mashriq (1923; \u201cMessage of the East\u201d), is an effective answer to Goethe \u2019s Poems of the East and West (1819). In the J\u0101v\u012bd-n\u0101meh (1932; \u201cThe Song of Eternity\u201d) he poetically elaborated the old topic of the \u201cheavenly journey,\u201d discussing with the inhabitants of the spheres a variety of political, social, and religious problems. Iqb\u0101l\u2019s approach is unique. Although he used the conventional literary forms and leaned heavily on the inspiration of Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-R\u016bm\u012b , he must be considered one of the select few poets of modern Islam who, because of their honesty and their capacity for expressing their message in memorable poetic form, appeal to many readers outside the Muslim world.",
  "The modern period of Islamic literatures can be said to begin after World War II. The topics discussed before then still appeared, but outspoken social criticism became an even more important feature. Literature was no longer a leisurely pastime for members of the upper classes. Writers born in the villages and from non-privileged classes began to win literary fame through their firsthand knowledge of social problems. Many writers started their careers as journalists, developing a literary style that retained the immediacy of journalistic observation.",
  "In Egypt a great change in literary preoccupations came about after 1952. The name of Naguib Mahfouz (died 2006) is of particular importance. He was at first a novelist mainly concerned with the lower middle classes (his outstanding work is a trilogy dealing with the life of a Cairo family), but afterward he turned to socially committed literature, using all the techniques of modern fiction\u2014of which he is the undisputed master in Arabic. In 1988 he became the first Arabic writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. The works of Y\u016bsuf Idr\u012bs (died 1991) deal first and foremost with the problems facing poor and destitute villagers, a subject also treated in \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n al-Sharq\u0101w\u012b\u2019s novel Al-Ar\u1e0d (1954; Egyptian Earth ). In Turkey, Ya\u015far (Yashar) Kemal\u2019s village story \u0130nce Memed (1955; Memed, My Hawk ) won acclaim for its stark realism. During the middle decades of the 20th century and beyond, young left-wing writers in Iraq and Syria shared the critical and aggressive attitudes of their contemporaries in Turkey and Egypt and took positions on all political issues. Most of them responded to the works of Bertolt Brecht and Karl Marx . Freudian influence\u2014often in its crudest form\u2014could be detected in many modern short stories or novels in the Islamic countries. In the Middle East the existentialist philosophy gained many followers who tried to reflect its interpretation of life in their literary works. In fact, almost every current of modern Western philosophy and psychology, every artistic trend and attitude, was eagerly adopted at some point by young Arab, Turkish, or Persian writers during the period after World War II. The novel gradually became more popular in the Arab world as the 20th century wore on. Mahfouz was probably the single most important figure in the genre\u2019s widespread acceptance. From the Turkish tradition emerged Orhan Pamuk , who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006; his novels reached a worldwide audience.",
  "The new attitudes that informed literature after World War II became even more conspicuous in poetry than in prose. Helped in part by French and English literary influences, Arabic poetry broke from classical tradition, a profound shift that also had its roots in efforts by nations across the Middle East to gain independence. The creation of the State of Israel also influenced the meaning and purpose of Arabic poetry. T.S. Eliot \u2019s poetry and criticism were influential in dethroning the Romanticism that many poets had adopted in the 1920s and \u201930s. One of the first and most important attempts at creating a modern Arabic poetic diction was made in the late 1940s by the Iraqi poet and critic Nazik al-Malaika (died 2007), whose poems, in free but rhyming verse, gave substance to the shadow of her melancholia. Free rhythm and a colourful imagination distinguished the best poems of the younger Arabs: even when their poems did not succeed, their experimentation, their striving for sincerity, their burning quest for identity, their rebellion against social injustice, could be readily perceived. Indeed, one of the most noticeable aspects of contemporary Arabic poetry written during the second half of the 20th century was its political engagement, evident in the poems of Palestinian writers such as Mahmoud Darwish (died 2008), whose verses once more prove the strength, expressiveness, and vitality of the Arabic language. The Iraqi modernist poet Abd al-Wahhab al-Bayati (died 1999) combined political engagement with lyrical mysticism. Others, without withdrawing into a world of uncommitted dreams, managed to create in their poetry an atmosphere that broke up the harsh light of reality into its colourful components. Poets such as the Lebanese Adonis and Tawfiq Sayigh (died 1971), or the Egyptian dramatist Salah Abdel Sabour (died 1981), made use of traditional imagery in a new, sometimes esoteric, often fascinating and daring way.",
  "Almost the same situation developed in Iran. One notable poet was Forugh Farrokhzad, who wrote powerful and feminine poetry. Her free verses, interpreting the insecurities of the age, are full of longing; though often bitter, they are truly poetic. Poems by such critically minded writers as Sey\u0101v\u016bsh Kasr\u0101\u02be\u012b also borrow the classical heritage of poetic imagery, transforming it into expressions that win a response from modern readers. After 1979, many writers in the Islamic Republic of Iran felt the pinch of censorship, and much literary activity was curtailed.",
  "In Turkey the adoption of Western forms began in the 1920s. Of major importance in modern Turkish literature was Orhan Veli Kan\u0131k (died 1950), who combined perfect technique with \u201cIstanbulian\u201d charm. His work is sometimes melancholy, sometimes frivolous, but always convincing. He strongly influenced a group of poets connected with the avant-garde literary magazine Varlik (\u201cExistence\u201d). The powerful poetry of the leftist writer Naz\u0131m Hikmet (died 1963) influenced progressive poets all over the Muslim world; Ataol Behramo\u011flu was often considered Hikmet\u2019s successor. Faz\u0131l H\u00fcsn\u00fc Da\u011flarca was another poet with leftist views. His modernist poetry made him one of Turkey\u2019s most influential poets during the post-World War II era. The poetry of Hilmi Yavuz melded the aesthetics of Ottoman civilization with modernist poetic forms. His interweaving of past and present was typical of many Turkish poets in the last decades of the 20th century.",
  "In the Arab-speaking world the problem of language loomed large into the 21st century. Classical high Arabic remained the common literary language of Morocco, Iraq, Tunisia, and Kuwait, although spoken Arabic in dialectal variations was beginning to be used\u2014but tentatively\u2014in higher literature. It was, and still is, more frequently employed in the popular spheres of theatre and cinema. But the local differences that exist in Arabic spoken from country to country have today become perceptible in literature; popular grammatical forms and syntactical constructions are occasionally used in modern poetry. A special problem arises in the North African countries, where French continues to be the chief literary language for most writers, especially in Morocco and Algeria. Yet there is no hard-and-fast rule: a leading member of Senegal\u2019s literary community, Amadou Bamba M\u2019backe, who founded the politically important group of the Mur\u012bdiyyah, wrote (quite apart from practical words of wisdom in his mother tongue) some 20,000 mystically tinged verses in Classical Arabic.",
  "Throughout the Islamic world, radio, television, and other media have helped to disseminate literary works, prizes for literary achievements have stimulated interest in writing, and low-priced books have made the output of a growing number of writers available to the majority\u2014the more so as literacy steadily increases among the population. But to what degree this means a continuation of the cultural role that Islamic literatures have played in the formation and education of society over the centuries is not yet clear. Literature was never restricted to a privileged high society; in the past even the illiterate villager and the \u201cuneducated\u201d womenfolk had a fund of poems, proverbs, songs, and quotations from classical sources that they knew by heart and to which they turned for both pleasure and spiritual strength.",
  "One final issue should be noted. The introduction in the second half of the 20th century of modern methods of criticism, of psychology and philosophy, kindled a new interest in significant figures of the Islamic past. Thus, to quote one instance, the figure of al-\u1e24all\u0101j (executed 922), who often served as a symbol figure of \u201cthe martyr of love\u201d in both classical and folk poetry after the 11th century, was made the subject of a Turkish drama, a Persian passion play, and an Arabic tragedy, and he plays an important role in Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Indian Muslim lyrical poetry. He came to be interpreted as a symbol of suffering for one\u2019s ideals, and he therefore was considered acceptable both to conservative Muslims and to progressive social critics.",
  "The development of literature during the early Middle Ages soon produced among the Arabs much lively literary criticism. Even the choice of quotations made by the ancient grammarians from the classical stock of poetry implies a degree of critical (though subjective) activity. Attempts toward making a more objective study of poetic technique were first made in the late 9th century, when for the first time \u201cbeauties\u201d and \u201cfaults\u201d of verses were discussed and the ideals of the \u201cnew style\u201d were defined by Ibn al-Mu\u02bftazz in his Kit\u0101b al-bad\u012b\u02bf ( The Book of Tropes ). The relation between laf\u1e93 (word) and ma\u02bfn\u0101 (meaning) has been a matter of some controversy; many earlier critics stress the importance of outward form rather than of content. There was some question, too, as to whether the most \u201cpoetical\u201d verse was that which was the most \u201cuntrue\u201d\u2014that is to say, hyperbolic\u2014or that which was closer to the heart of things. The matter was debated along with the problem of inspiration and imagination and their function in poetry. The most thorough analysis of the art of poetry was made by the 11th-century philologist \u02bfAbd al-Q\u0101hir al-Jurj\u0101n\u012b, who gave equal weight to the idea and to the way it was expressed. An illuminating work about poetics was composed by the Tunisian critic al-Qar\u1e6d\u0101jann\u012b (13th century), and this was carefully studied by the German scholar Wolfhart Heinrichs in Arabische Dichtung und griechische Poetik (1969). This study analyzes al-Qar\u1e6d\u0101jann\u012b\u2019s theories in relation to Aristotle \u2019s theories of poetics. (Heinrichs, who was at the time his study was published one of the few Islamic scholars specializing in the study of literary problems, showed that Classical Arabic criticism rarely interested itself in the poem as a whole but concentrated upon individual verses.) In later centuries, manuals of poetics and rhetoric written in every Islamic country reveal the prevailing interest in purely formal problems.",
  "A similar interest long dominated the work of Western scholars of the East. The first scholars who attempted to introduce Persian poetry to Western readers (such as Sir William Jones in the 18th century) felt compelled to compare it with the compositions of Greek and Latin poetry. The verbal ingenuity of al-\u1e24ar\u012br\u012b\u2019s 11th-century Maq\u0101m\u0101t (published in English as The Assemblies of al-Har\u012br\u012b ) attracted the European scholars, who took great pleasure in disentangling the grammatically difficult forms. Pre-Islamic poetry at first interested only the grammarian-antiquarian until its importance as a source of knowledge of early Bedouin life was recognized. The art of versification and problems of Classical Arabic metrics became matters of intense discussion among Western scholars of the East.",
  "Although a large amount of translation, mainly from Persian poetry, was produced in the 18th and 19th centuries, most of it suffered for lack of proper understanding: the translators took the poetical statements about wine and love or the outbursts against established religious forms at face value and failed to recognize them for the stereotyped forms and images they were. A deep study of the imagery of Persian, Turkish, and Arabic is essential for the proper understanding and enjoyment of their poetry and belles lettres. Austrian scholar Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall recognized this as early as 1818, though his own translations from the three great Islamic languages are nevertheless failures.",
  "In the 20th century the critical study of imagery in poetry produced in the Islamic world was taken up by Hellmut Ritter in his booklet \u00dcber die Bildersprache Ni\u1e93\u0101m\u012bs (1927; \u201cOn the Imagery of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b \u201d), which gives a most sensitive philosophical interpretation of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\u2019s metaphorical language and of the role of imagery in the structure of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\u2019s thought. Ritter\u2019s criticism is basic to the study of many other Persian poets. Slightly later the Polish scholar Tadeusz Kowalski tried to interpret the \u201cmolecular\u201d structure of Arabic literature\u2014the absence of large units of thought or architectural structure\u2014typical of the greater part of Islamic literatures, which might be described as \u201ccarpetlike.\u201d This \u201cmolecular\u201d structure can be related to the atomist theories and occasionalist worldview embodied in Islamic theology, which, unlike Christianity, does not admit of secondary causes and requires only short spans of hope from the faithful. In a number of articles, and in many books, E.G. von Grunebaum pioneered this interpretation of literary structure during the 20th century. Other important critical works of the period include S.A. Bonebakker\u2019s book on the rhetorical importance of tawriyyah (ambiguous wording), Manfred Ullmann\u2019s excellent study of rajaz poetry and its place in Arabic literature, and C.H. de Fouch\u00e9cour\u2019s detailed analysis of the descriptions of nature in early Persian poetry.",
  "Among the Arabs themselves, modern literary criticism began during the early 1920s. Most famous was Taha Hussein\u2019s attempt to prove the whole corpus of pre-Islamic poetry as counterfeit. All the Islamic countries, from Turkey to Pakistan and especially Iran, also sponsored reviews in which Western-trained scholars critically surveyed the literary achievements of the Islamic world.",
  "The period of Islamic music begins with the advent of Islam about 610 ce . A new art emerged, elaborated both from pre-Islamic Arabian music and from important contributions by Persians, Byzantines, Turks, Imazighen (Berbers), and Moors. In this development the Arabian element acted as a catalyst, and, within a century, the new art was firmly established from Central Asia to the Atlantic. Such a fusion of musical styles succeeded because there were strong affinities between Arabian music and the music of the nations occupied by the expanding Arabic peoples. Not all Arab-dominated areas adopted the new art; Indonesia and parts of Africa, for example, retained native musical styles. The folk music of the Berbers in North Africa, the Moors in Mauretania, and other ethnic groups (e.g., in Turkey) also remained alien to classical Islamic music. The farther one looks from the axis reaching from the Nile valley to Persia, the less one finds undiluted Islamic music.",
  "(It should be remembered that the word music and its concept were reserved for secular art music; separate names and concepts belonged to folk songs and to religious chants.)",
  "Islamic music is characterized by a highly subtle organization of melody and rhythm, in which the vocal component predominates over the instrumental. It is based on the skill of the individual artist, who is both composer and performer and who benefits from a relatively high degree of artistic freedom. The artist is permitted, and indeed encouraged, to improvise. He generally concentrates on the details forming a work, being less concerned with following a preconceived plan than with allowing the music\u2019s structure to emerge empirically from its details. Melodies are organized in terms of maq\u0101m\u0101t (singular maq\u0101m ), or \u201cmodes,\u201d characteristic melodic patterns with prescribed scales, preferential notes, typical melodic and rhythmic formulas, variety of intonations, and other conventional devices. The performer improvises within the framework of the maq\u0101m , which is also imbued with ethos (Arabic ta\u02beth\u012br ), a specific emotional or philosophical meaning attached to a musical mode. Rhythms are organized into rhythmic modes, or \u012bq\u0101\u02bf\u0101t (singular \u012bq\u0101\u02bf ), cyclical patterns of strong and weak beats.",
  "Classical Islamic music is the aristocratic music of the court and the upper class, which underwent development and modification in the hands of gifted musicians throughout several centuries. Rhythmic and melodic modes grew in number and complexity, and new vocal and instrumental genres arose. In addition, a body of theoretical works grew up, influencing both Islamic and\u2014in some cases\u2014European music. Its later popularization did not alter its intimate and entertaining character.",
  "In pre-Islamic times music was closely connected with poetry and dance. Being essentially vocal, pre-Islamic music was an emotional extension of the solemn declamation of poems in Bedouin society. Later the art of vocal composition itself was largely based upon prosody: only by respecting the poetic metre in the music could the text, when sung, be clear in meaning and correct in pronunciation and grammatical inflection. In turn, prosody itself was used to explain the musical rhythm.",
  "Words and rhetorical speech were the principal means through which the Bedouin expressed feelings. The sh\u0101\u02bfir , or poet-musician, said to be possessed by supernatural powers, was feared and respected. His satirical song poems were a formidable arm against enemies, and his poems of praise enhanced the prestige of his tribe. Musician-poets, especially women, accompanied the warriors, inciting them by their songs, and those who fell in battle benefited from the elegies of the singer-poets. Musically, these elegies resembled the \u1e25ud\u0101\u02be (\u201ccaravan song\u201d), possibly used by camel drivers as a charm against the desert spirits, or jinn .",
  "Music and dance were closely associated from early times. Bedouin music had a pronounced collective character, with well-defined functions and usages, and dance occupied an important place in Bedouin life. Most common was a simple communal dance that emphasized common, or social, rather than individual movement. Places of entertainment in the towns and oases employed professional dancers, mainly women. Art dancing embellished events in the courts of the Sasanians, the pre-Islamic rulers of Persia. In the Islamic period, solo and ensemble forms of dance were an integral part of the intense musical activity in the palaces of the caliphs and in wealthy houses. Dance also was prominent in the  dhikr  ceremony of certain mystical fraternities; forms ranged from obsessional physical movements to refined styles similar to those of secular art dancing.",
  "After the advent of Islam a deep change occurred in the social function of music. Emphasis was laid on music as entertainment and sensual pleasure rather than as a source of high spiritual emotion, a change mainly resulting from Persian influence. Knowledge of music was obligatory for the cultured person. Skilled professional musicians were highly paid and were admitted to the caliphs\u2019 palaces as courtesans and trusted companions. The term \u1e6darab , which designates a whole scale of emotions, characterizes the musical conception of the time and even came to mean music itself.",
  "Fashionable secular music\u2014and its clear association with erotic dance and drinking\u2014stimulated hostile reactions from religious authorities. As Muslim doctrine does not sanction permitting or prohibiting a given practice by personal decision, the antagonists relied on forced interpretations of a few unclear passages in the Qur\u02be\u0101n (the sacred scripture of Islam) or on the Had\u012bth (traditions of the Prophet, sayings and practices that had acquired force of law). Thus, both supporters and adversaries of music found arguments for their theses.",
  "In the controversy, four main groups emerged: (1) uncompromising purists opposed to any musical expression; (2) religious authorities admitting only the cantillation of the Qur\u02be\u0101n and the call to prayer, or  adh\u0101n  ; (3) scholars and musicians favouring music, believing there to be no musical difference between secular and religious music; and (4) important mystical fraternities, for whom music and dance were a means toward unity with God.",
  "Except in the Sufi brotherhoods, Muslim religious music is relatively curtailed because of the opposition of religious leaders. It falls into two categories: the call to prayer, or adh\u0101n (in some places, az\u0304\u0101n ), by the mu\u02beadhdhin , or muezzin , and the cantillation of the Qur\u02be\u0101n. Both developed from relatively solemn cantillation to a variety of forms, both simple and highly florid. The cantillation of the Qur\u02be\u0101n reflected the ancient Arabic practice of declamation of poetry, with careful regard to word accents and inflections and to the clarity of the text. Yet it was possibly also influenced by early secular art song. Opponents of music considered the cantillation of the Qur\u02be\u0101n to be technically distinct from singing, and it acquired a separate terminology. Synagogues and the Eastern Christian churches, unhampered by such opposition, developed extensive musical repertories based on melodic modes: the Eastern churches used the eight modes of Byzantine music , while synagogue music followed the  maq\u0101m  system of Muslim art music.",
  "Even in its most complicated aspects, Islamic music is traditional and is transmitted orally. A rudimentary notational system did exist but it was used only for pedagogical purposes. A large body of medieval writing about music survives in which musical theory is related to various areas of intellectual activity, hence the extreme importance of understanding music as an element of the culture involved. The medieval writings fall mainly into two categories: (1) literary, encyclopaedic, and anecdotal sources, and (2) theoretical, speculative sources. The first group includes precious information on musical life, musicians, aesthetic controversies, education, and the theory of musical practice. The second deals with acoustics, intervals (distances between notes), musical genres, scales, measures of instruments, the theory of composition, rhythm, and the mathematical aspects of music. These documents show that, as in the modern era, medieval Islamic music was principally an individual, soloistic art. Small ensembles were actually groups of soloists with the principal member, usually the singer, predominating. Being an essentially vocal music, it displayed many singing and vocal techniques, such as special vocal colour, guttural nasality, vibrato, and other stylistic ornaments. Although the music was based upon strict rules, preexisting melodies, and stylistic requirements, the performer enjoyed great creative freedom. The artist was expected to bring his contribution to a given traditional piece through improvisation, original ornamentation, and his own approach to tempo, rhythmic pattern, and the distribution of the text over the melody. Thus the artist functioned as both performer and composer.",
  "Islamic music is monophonic; i.e., it consists of a single line of melody. In performance everything is related to the refinement of the melodic line and the complexity of rhythm. The notion of harmony is completely absent, although occasionally a simple combination of notes, octaves, fifths, and fourths, usually below the melody notes, may be used as an ornamentation. Among the elements contributing to the enrichment of the melody are microtonality (the use of intervals smaller than a Western half step or lying between a half step and a Western whole step) and the variety of intervals used. Thus, the three-quarter tone, introduced into Islamic music in the 9th or 10th century, exists alongside larger and smaller intervals. Musicians show a keen sensibility to nuances of pitch, often slightly varying even the perfect consonances, the fourth and fifth.",
  "As the fourth is the basic melodic frame, theorists organized the intervals and their nuances into genres, or small units, often tetrachords (units the highest and lowest notes of which are a fourth apart), combining genres into larger units, or systems. More than 130 systems resulted; on these are based the musical scales of the maq\u0101m\u0101t , or modes. The scale of a maq\u0101m can thus be broken down into small units that are of importance in the formation of melodies. A maq\u0101m is a complex musical entity given distinct musical character by its given scale, small units, range and compass, predominant notes, and preexisting typical melodic and rhythmic formulas. It serves the musician as rough material for his own composition. Each maq\u0101m has a proper name that may refer to a place (as Hejaz, Iraq), to a famous man, or to an object, feeling, quality, or special event. Emotional or philosophical meaning (ethos, or ta\u02beth\u012br ) and cosmological background are attached to a maq\u0101m and also to the rhythmic modes. The Arabic term maq\u0101m is the equivalent of dastg\u0101h in Persia, naghmah in Egypt, and \u1e6dab in North Africa.",
  "Rhythms and their organization into cycles of beats and pauses of varying lengths (rhythmic modes, or \u012bq\u0101\u02bf\u0101t ) are much discussed in theoretical writings and are of supreme importance in performance. Each cycle consists of a fixed number of time units with a characteristic distribution of strong and weak beats and pauses. In performance some of the pauses may be filled in, but the underlying pattern must be maintained. Parallel to the growth of the number of melodic modes\u2014from 12 in the 8th century to more than 100 in the 20th\u2014is the increase in the number of rhythmic modes from 8 in the 9th century to more than 100 in the 20th.",
  "The repertoire in common use comprises a wide variety of forms. One category includes unmeasured improvised pieces, such as the lay\u0101l\u012b , in which the singer puts forth the characteristics of the maq\u0101m , vocalizing long expressive syllables. An equivalent instrumental improvisation is called taqs\u012bm , and this in some cases may be accompanied by a uniform pulsation, called taqs\u012bm \u02bfala al-wu\u1e25dah . The category of metrical songs embraces various poetic forms and metric structures, such as qa\u1e63\u012bdah, dor , and muwashsha\u1e25 . Both categories, metrical and unmeasured, are almost always accompanied by either one or more instruments to enrich the performance. Important traditional forms combined both categories to create large compositions similar to a suite, using vocal and instrumental features. The whole was linked by the unity of the mode and a defined rhythmical development. Examples are the Andalusian n\u016bbah , which survives in North Africa, the Persian dastg\u0101h , the Turkish f\u0101\u1e63il , the Egyptian wa\u1e63la , and the Iraqi macam . Under the pressure of modernization and westernization have emerged new forms showing the influence of light dance music, operetta, and musical comedy.",
  "Instrumental music is not considered an independent art from vocal music. Yet many instruments were fully described by early writers, and their use in folk, art, religious, and military music pointed out. The most favoured instrument of ancient Middle Eastern civilization, the harp, was gradually overshadowed by both long- and short-necked lutes.",
  "Among idiophones (instruments the hard bodies of which vibrate to produce sound) commonly used are the qa\u1e0d\u012bb (\u201cpercussion stick\u201d), the zil and sun\u016bj (\u201ccymbals\u201d), and the k\u0101\u1e63\u0101t , or small finger cymbals. Membranophones, or vibrating membrane instruments, include a variety of tambourines, or frame drums, which all fall under the generic name duff . These include the North African ghirb\u0101l and bend\u012br , instruments that have a number of \u201csnares\u201d across the skin and are used for folk dances; and the d\u0101\u02beirah , or \u1e6dar , with jingling plates or rings set in the frame. The d\u0101\u02beirah and the vase-shaped drum darabukka (in Iran, z\u0304arb ) are used in folk and art music, and the small kettledrums naqq\u0101rah and nuqayrat are used in art music and in military music (such as janissary music, the Turkish ensemble adopted by European military musicians). The large two-headed cylindrical drum, the \u1e6dabl (Turkish davul ), is generally played with the oboe-like zorn\u0101 or gayta in processions and open-air ceremonies.",
  "Classed with the zorn\u0101 and gayta as aerophones, or wind instruments, are the b\u016bq , or horn, the naf\u012br , or long trumpet, and a variety of flutes called n\u0101y or shabb\u0101bah . Clarinetlike (single-reed) double-piped instruments such as the dunay, zamm\u0101rah , and urgh\u016bl are used in folk events and open-air ceremonies.",
  "Chordophones, or stringed instruments, constitute the most important family. The favourite instrument of Islamic classical music is the \u02bf\u016bd (oud), a short-necked lute, with a bowl-like wooden body, a backward-slanting pegbox, and usually four to six courses of strings, that resembles the Western lute, which derived from the \u02bf\u016bd . In addition to holding musical supremacy, it was important in medieval theoretical and cosmological speculations. It has two derivatives in North Africa, the kuw\u012btra and the gunbr\u012b . The long-necked lutes favoured in Turkey, Iran, and the countries eastward include the \u1e6dunb\u016br, t\u0101r , and set\u0101r . Another plucked instrument is the q\u0101n\u016bn , or trapezoid-shaped psaltery, played at least from early medieval times. The trapezoidal dulcimer, or san\u1e6d\u016br , the strings of which are struck with two thin sticks, is widespread and is especially prominent in Persian art music. Bowed lutes, or fiddles, include the rab\u0101b , used by epic singers and beggars, and the kam\u0101n , or kamanj\u0101 , a hemispherically-shaped fiddle the body of which, like that of the rab\u0101b , is pierced by the length of wood forming the neck (such instruments are known as spike fiddles). The violin, played either on the knee like the kamanj\u0101 , or beneath the collarbone, is also common.",
  "The relation of Islamic music to the West reveals itself in both musical theory and practice. By the 9th century many Greek treatises had been translated into Arabic. Arabic culture preserved Greek musical writings, and most of those that reached the West did so in their Arabic versions. Arab theorists followed Greek models, often developing them further. The Muslim occupation of Spain and Portugal and the Crusades to the Middle East brought Europeans in contact with Arabic theoretical writings and the flourishing Islamic art music. Musical instruments such as the lute, the rebec (a small bowed instrument derived from the rab\u0101b ), and the kettledrum (in the form of a pair of small kettledrums called nakers, from the Arabic naqq\u0101rah ) became firmly established in European music. Arabic writings were translated, among them the De scientiis , a work on the arts and sciences by the great 10th-century philosopher and musician al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (Latinized as Alpharabius). Such translations give further indication of the influence exerted by Muslim writers. Arabian influence on European medieval music is difficult to prove. Borrowed elements were possibly completely transformed. The influence of Islamic music on European music is, at present, a subject of controversy.",
  "As early as 711, Arab conquerors reached India, and Mongol and Turkmen armies later invaded the Middle East, with resulting contact between Islamic and Far Eastern music. There are similarities between the modal systems of India (the ragas) and of the Middle East (the maq\u0101m system) and between some cosmological and ethical conceptions of music. The migration of musical instruments from the Islamic area to East Asia can also be traced. The Chinese oboe, the suona , apparently derived its name from its Middle Eastern counterpart, the zorn\u0101 , or sorn\u0101 . The Indian long-necked lute sitar, having a different number of strings from the Persian set\u0101r , received its name, and perhaps part of its form, from the set\u0101r . The Chinese dulcimer, yangqin (\u201cforeign zither\u201d), originated in the Middle Eastern san\u1e6d\u016br . On the other hand, the musical instruments appearing in the pre-Islamic \u1e6c\u0101q-e Bost\u0101n reliefs in Persia show a mouth organ similar to the Chinese sheng , indigenous to East Asia.",
  "The earliest extant writings on Islamic music are from the end of the 9th century, more than 250 years after the advent of Islam. In the absence of historical documents, musicians, writers, and philosophers began to speculate on the origins of their music. They filled the gaps by legendary sources or vague traditions. Thus, Lamak is said to have made the first lute from the leg of his dead son, whose loss he lamented with it. His lamentation is considered to be the first song.",
  "In nomadic encampments music emphasized every event in man\u2019s life, embellished social meetings, incited the warriors, encouraged the desert traveler, and exhorted the pilgrims to the black stone of the Ka\u02bfbah (in Mecca), a holy shrine even in pre-Islamic times. Among the earliest songs were the \u1e25ud\u0101\u02be from which the ghin\u0101\u02be derived, the na\u1e63b, sanad, rukb\u0101n\u012b , and the haz\u0101j , a dancing song. In the markets of the Arabs, particularly the fair at the western Arabian town of \u02bfUk\u0101\u1e93, competitions of poetry and musical performances were held periodically, attracting the most distinguished poet-musicians. Their music, more sophisticated than that practiced in the nomadic encampments, was related to that of the qayn\u0101t (\u201csinging girls\u201d), who performed at court, in noble households, and in scattered taverns. Cultural contact with Byzantium was strong in the kingdom of Ghass\u0101n, where, in the 7th century, five Byzantine qayn\u0101t were known to have performed songs of their homeland at court. The culture of the other Arabic kingdom of al-\u1e24\u012brah under the Lakhmid dynasty was closely connected with that of Persia under the pre-Islamic Sasanian empire. The Sasanians esteemed both secular and religious music. In the belief of the Mazdak sect (a dualistic Persian religion related to Manichaeanism , a gnostic religion), music was considered as one of the four spiritual powers. In the king\u2019s entourage musicians occupied high rank. Some became famous, such as B\u0101rbad, to whom is attributed the invention of the complicated pre-Islamic system of modes. The compositions of B\u0101rbad, who became a model of artistic achievement in Arabic literature, survived at least until the 10th century.",
  "Muhammad was said to have been hostile to music and musicians, yet there are indications that he tolerated functional music such as war songs, pilgrimage chants, and public or private festival songs. In addition, he himself instituted in 622 or 623 the adh\u0101n (\u201ccall to prayer\u201d), chanted by the mu\u02beadhdhin (muezzin). For this task he chose the Abyssinian singer Bil\u0101l, who became the patron of the mu\u02beadhdhin and their guilds throughout the Islamic world. Within 12 years after Muhammad\u2019s death, the armies of Islam took possession of Syria, Iraq, Persia, Armenia, Egypt, and Cyrenaica (in modern Libya). The contact with the refined cultures of the conquered and the appearance of a new class of warriors who benefited from the spoils of the conquered nations deeply affected Arabian society. In spite of the austere regime of the four orthodox caliphs (632\u2013660), joy of life and eagerness for pleasure dominated the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Wealthy men competed with one another in hosting brilliant concerts, which were performed by enslaved musicians taken from the conquered populations. On occasions when enslaved musicians were liberated, they often became the pillars of musical life. In sophisticated literary and musical salons, contests revealed and rewarded the best talents. In this milieu the great Islamic musical tradition began to take shape, to be firmly established and codified in subsequent periods. A new generation of musicians was educated in the traditional manner and refined through constant hearing of the best music performed by the best masters. Through the contributions of the conquered \u201cforeigners,\u201d and through intense emulation of their music, new techniques, improved instruments, and elaborated musical forms developed. Persian lute tuning was adopted for the lute ( \u02bf\u016bd ), which became the classical instrument of the Arabs. Melodies and rhythms were regulated by a modal system that was later codified. Among the most famous female musicians was \u02bfAzza al-Mayl\u0101\u02be, who excelled in al-ghin\u0101\u02be al-raq\u012bq , or \u201cgentle song.\u201d Her house was the most brilliant literary salon of Medina, and most of the famous musicians of the town came under her tutelage. Also famed were the female musician Jam\u012blah, around whom clustered musicians, poets, and dignitaries; the male musician \u1e6cuways, who imitated the melodies he heard from captive Persians; and \u1e62\u0101\u02beib Kh\u0101thir, a Persian merchant. Songs were generally accompanied by the lute ( \u02bf\u016bd ), the frame drum ( duff ), or the percussion stick ( qa\u1e0d\u012bb ).",
  "Under the Umayyad caliphate (661\u2013750) the classical style of Islamic music developed further. The capital was moved to Damascus (in modern Syria) and the courts were thronged with male and female musicians, who formed a class apart. Many prominent musicians were Arab by birth or acculturation, but the non-Arab influences continued to play a predominant role in Islamic music. The first and the greatest musician of the Umayyad era was Ibn Misja\u1e25, often honoured as the father of Islamic music. Born in Mecca of a Persian family, he was a musical theorist and a skilled singer and lute player. Ibn Misja\u1e25 traveled to Syria and Persia, learning the theory and practice of Byzantine and Persian music and incorporating much of his acquired knowledge into the Arabian art song. Although he adopted new elements such as foreign musical modes, he rejected other musical traits as unsuitable to Arabian music. Knowledge of his contributions is contained in the most important source of information about music and musical life in the first three centuries of Islam. This is the 10th-century Kit\u0101b al-Agh\u0101n\u012b , or \u201cBook of Songs,\u201d by Ab\u016b al-Faraj al-I\u1e63bah\u0101n\u012b. In the 8th century Y\u016bnus al-K\u0101tib, author of the first Arabic book of musical theory, compiled the first collection of songs. Other notable musicians of the period were Ibn Mu\u1e25riz, of Persian ancestry; Ibn Surayj, also of Persian ancestry and noted for his elegies and improvisations ( murtajal ); his pupil al-Ghar\u012b\u1e0d, born of a Berber family; and Ma\u02bfbad, a Black student of Jam\u012blah. Like Ibn Surayj, Ma\u02bfbad cultivated a special personal style adopted by following generations of singers.",
  "By the end of the Umayyad period, the disparate elements of conqueror and conquered were fused into the style of classical Islamic music. With the establishment of the Abbasid caliphate in 750, Baghdad (in modern Iraq) became the leading musical centre. The Abbasid caliphate is the period of the golden age in Islamic music. Music, obligatory for every learned man, was dealt with in varied aspects\u2014among them virtuosity, aesthetic theory, ethical and therapeutic goals, mystical experience, and mathematical speculation. The artist was required to possess technical proficiency, creative power, and almost encyclopaedic knowledge. Among the finest artists of the period were Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Maw\u1e63il\u012b and his son Is\u1e25\u0101q. Members of a noble Persian family, they were chief court musicians and close companions of the caliphs H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd and al-Ma\u02bem\u016bn .",
  "Is\u1e25\u0101q, a singer, composer, and virtuoso lutenist, was the outstanding musician of his time. A man of wide culture, he is credited with authorship of nearly 40 works on music, which were subsequently lost. According to the \u201cBook of Songs,\u201d he is the originator of the earliest Islamic theory of melodic modes. Called a\u1e63bi\u02bf (\u201cfingers\u201d), it structured the modes according to the frets of the lute and the fingers corresponding to them. Indications above each song in the \u201cBook of Songs\u201d show the mode, the type of third (major, minor, or neutral), and often the rhythmic mode. (The third is the interval encompassing three notes of the scale. It can vary considerably in exact size without losing its character. Western music uses the major and the minor third; much non-Western and folk music also uses a neutral third, between the major and minor in size.) The neutral third, introduced into Islamic music about this time, increased the number of melodic modes from eight to 12 by making more intervals available from which to build melodies. At this time the number of rhythmic modes varied from six to eight, their actual structure and content differing from author to author.",
  "Is\u1e25\u0101q and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Maw\u1e63il\u012b actively participated in the contemporary controversy between modernism, a Persian romantic style tending toward exuberance of embellishments, and Arabian classicism, characterized by simplicity and artistic severity. The Maw\u1e63il\u012bs represented the older classical tradition; the proponents of modernism were Ibn J\u0101mi\u02bf and the celebrated singer Prince Ibr\u0101h\u012bm ibn al-Mahd\u012b.",
  "In the second half of the 8th century, the extensive Islamic literature of music theory began to flourish. Greek treatises were translated into Arabic, and scholars, who were acquainted with the Greek writings, began to devote books or sections of books to the theory of music. In their works they expanded, changed, improved, or shed new light on Greek musical theory. The well-known philosopher al-Kind\u012b, who was deeply immersed in Greek learning, wrote more than 13 musical treatises, including the earliest Arabic musical treatise that is known to have survived. He also dealt with the theory of ethos ( ta\u02beth\u012br ) and with cosmological aspects of music. Members of the Ikhw\u0101n al-\u1e62af\u0101, an important 10th-century brotherhood, dealt also with these two themes and advanced a theory of sound that went well beyond ancient Greek theories. Philosophers such as al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, author of the monumental Kit\u0101b al-mus\u012bq\u012b al-Kab\u012br (\u201cGrand Book on Music\u201d), and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (known in Europe as Avicenna) dealt with such topics as the theory of sound, intervals, genres and systems, composition, rhythm, and instruments, as did others such as al-Sarakhs\u012b, his contemporary Th\u0101bit ibn Qurrah, and Avicenna\u2019s pupil Ibn Zayl\u0101. The last important theorist to emerge during the Abbasid period was \u1e62af\u012b al-D\u012bn, who codified the elements of the modal practice as it was then known into a highly sophisticated system. His achievement became the chief model for subsequent generations. In the numerous treatises written between the 13th and 19th centuries, the system devised by \u1e62af\u012b al-D\u012bn was split into multiple local traditions.",
  "Parallel to the flourishing of music at the eastern centres of Damascus and Baghdad, another important musical centre developed in Spain, first under the survivors of the Umayyad rulers and later under the Berber Almoravids (rulers of North Africa and Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries) and Almohads , who expanded into Spain after the fall of the Almoravids. In Spain, encounter with different cultures stimulated the development of the Andalusian, or Moorish, branch of Islamic music. The most imposing figure in this development is Ziry\u0101b (flourished 9th century), a pupil of Is\u1e25\u0101q al-Maw\u1e63il\u012b, who, because of the jealousy of his teacher, emigrated from Baghdad to Spain. A virtuoso singer and the leading musician at the court of C\u00f3rdoba , Ziry\u0101b introduced a fifth string to the lute, devised a number of new forms of composition, and developed a variety of new methods of teaching singing in his well-known school of music. Musical activity spread to large towns, and Sevilla (Seville) became a leading centre of musical-instrument manufacture.",
  "New poetic forms were developed, such as the muwashsha\u1e25 and the zajal , that were freer in rhyme and metre than the classical qa\u1e63\u012bdah or formal ode. These innovations in prosody opened the way to further musical developments. Especially important was the nawbah (\u201csuite\u201d), a form that included songs and instrumental music, free or metrical, that were linked together by melodic mode and rhythmic patterns. The 24 traditional nawbah s were invested with symbolic and cosmological significance. After the expulsion of the Muslims from Spain in 1492 this musical tradition was transported to North African centres, where it partially survived.",
  "After the Mongol invasion of Baghdad in 1258 and the Spanish reconquest of Granada in 1492, the magnificence of Islamic culture gradually waned. Music continued to be cultivated, receiving new influences from Mongol and Turkmen conquerors. Persia enjoyed artistic independence for about 450 years, until 1918; but during this period a huge area, from the Balkans to Tunisia, was submitted to a strong Turkish influence, which itself was heavily influenced by Arab and Persian music.",
  "From the beginning of the 19th century, Islamic music was affected by the intensification of contacts and relationships with Western music. For the first time Islamic music existed in juxtaposition with Western music. For example, European composers and musicians were summoned to create military bands and conservatories in Turkey (1826) and in Persia (1856), and Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s opera Aida inaugurated the opera house in Cairo in 1871. Expanding contact with Western music caused certain alterations in traditional musical styles. There was a widespread musical renaissance, with two main centres: the leading school in Egypt was open to modernism and Western influences, while in Syria and Iraq traditional music was supported. Music in Syria and Iraq, together with North African, Iranian, and Turkish music, remained restricted to its own periphery. The Egyptian school developed Middle Eastern music in what can be called the mainstream style; and this music was widely diffused through the media of radio, television, recordings, and the cinema. Mainstream music borrowed instruments such as the cello, saxophone, and accordion; melodies and rhythms from European serious and light music; the concept of large ensembles; and the use of electronic amplification. Emphasis shifted from the display of individual virtuosity and personal creativity to performance as an ensemble, and the use of short songs underscored the separation, rather than the traditional union, of composer and performer. Classical and local genres coexist, however, with the innovative mainstream style.",
  "Persian art music continues to be organized into 12 traditional modes, or dastg\u0101h , each of which contains a repertory of from 20 to 50 small pieces called g\u016bsheh s (\u201ccorners\u201d). In performance of instrumental and vocal music, the artist improvises on the chosen g\u016bsheh s of a dastg\u0101h in a specific order.",
  "Vocal music still predominates even in countries such as Iran, in which instrumental music is cultivated independently. Thus, almost all of the Middle Eastern musicians who are well known are singers; those particularly influential in the modern renaissance, in chronological order, include \u02bfAbduh al-\u1e24am\u016bl\u012b, D\u0101\u02be\u016bd \u1e24usn\u012b, Sayyid Darw\u012bsh, \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b, Umm Kulth\u016bm, Far\u012bd al-A\u1e6drash, Fayrouz, Rashid al-Hundarashi, \u1e62ad\u012bqah al-Mul\u0101ya, and Mu\u1e25ammad al-Gubanshi.",
  "Modern Arab theorists also have produced valuable treatises. For example, the 19th-century theorists Michel Muchaqa of Damascus and Mohammed Chehab al-D\u012bn of Cairo introduced the theoretical division of the scale into 24 quarter tones. In 1932 the international Congress of Arabian Music was held in Cairo, providing a forum for current analysis of subjects such as musical scales, modes, rhythms, and musical forms.",
  "The performing arts have received comparatively little attention in the otherwise rich literature of the Islamic peoples. This is most probably a result of the suspicions entertained by some orthodox Muslim scholars concerning the propriety of dance and theatre. Because this applies particularly in relation to the vexing theological question of human portrayal and its connection with idolatry, the performing arts have traditionally been regarded by the faithful with more than usual caution. Even as late as the 19th and early 20th centuries, most research on the subject, in what may loosely be called the Islamic world, was carried out by Western scholars, chiefly from European nations, and only in the 20th century did indigenous scholars start publishing significant research on the subject.",
  "  There are no known references to dance or theatre in pre-Islamic Arabia, although nomad tribes were probably acquainted with dance. The Islamic peoples themselves seem to have developed this particular art form less than they did music or architecture, and, in addition to medieval Islam\u2019s cool attitude toward dance and theatre as art forms, it must be added that most women, leading a life of seclusion, could hardly be expected to play an active part in them, except in private and exclusive gatherings. Nevertheless, there has been an active tradition of folk dance in most Islamic countries, in addition to dancing as an entertainment spectacle and, particularly in Persia, as an art form. A ritual dance was instituted in the Sufi mystical order of the Mawlawiyyah (Mevleviyah) in Turkey; performed by dervishes (members of the mystical order), it is considered to be a manifestation of mystical ecstasy rather than an entertainment or an expression of aesthetic urges.",
  "The theatre has not flourished as a major art under Islam, although as a form of popular entertainment, particularly in mime and shadow puppet shows, it has persisted vigorously. Nevertheless, the theatre with live actors received support from the Ottomans in Turkey, and a live popular drama was strong in Persia, where a passion play also took root. Otherwise, the theatrical record of Islam is meagre. Moreover, few neighbouring peoples had a well-developed theatre of their own. Hence, outside stimulus was lacking, and the Islamic disapproval of idolatry was so intense that when the shadow theatre evolved in the East, in the late Middle Ages, the puppets were regularly punched with holes to show that they were lifeless. Nonetheless, drama has had some ties with religion, as in Iran and other areas where the Shi\u02bfi branch of Islam is concentrated and a passion play developed, rooted in traumatic memories of the bloody warfare of Islam\u2019s early years. This was a local phenomenon, uninfluenced by Christian Europe, and, though stereotyped, it movingly reenacted Shi\u02bfi martyrdom.",
  "A popular theatre, frequently including dance, evolved independently from about the 17th century in some Muslim countries. Western European and, later, U.S. influences were largely the main factors in the development of an artistic theatre in the 19th century and beyond. But conservative Muslims have consistently disapproved of theatre, and in Saudi Arabia, for example, no native theatrical establishment exists. In such an atmosphere, women\u2019s roles were at first taken by men; later, Christian and Jewish women took the roles, and only in the 20th century did Muslim women begin to participate.",
  "Folk dancing existed among medieval Islamic peoples, but the sources that record dancing are mainly concerned with artistic dance, which was performed chiefly at the caliph\u2019s palace by skilled women. The aristocracy was quick to imitate this patronage by providing similar performances, its members vying with one another on festive occasions. One of those dances, the kurra\u011f (sometimes called kurra ), developed into a song and dance festival held at the caliph\u2019s court. Since the latter part of the 19th century, the dancing profession has lost ground to the performance of U.S., Latin American, and western European dances in cabarets . In a reaction that set in after World War II, fervent nationalists have tried to create native dance troupes, revive traditional motifs in costume and interpretation, and adapt tribal figures to modern settings. Few traditional dances have survived unchanged; among those that have are the dervish dances, performed mainly in Turkey.",
  "Though now performed and fostered chiefly as an expression of national culture, folk dances were long regarded as pure entertainment and were either combined with theatrical shows or presented alone. Dance performances, accompanied by music, took place in a special hall or outdoors; many dancers, particularly the males, were also mimes. Sometimes the dance enacted a pantomime, as in Turkey, of physical love or of a stag hunt. Folk dance, except in Iran, has almost always been mimetic or narrative, a tradition still fostered by many tribes.",
  "The Turks considered dancing a profession for the lowborn; as a result, most dancers were members of minority groups\u2014mostly Greeks, Jews, and Armenians. This judgment has usually applied to the status of professional dancers and indeed to most professional entertainers at most periods and in most societies until modern times. In 19th-century Egypt both male and female dancers were regarded as public entertainers. Many of the women entertainers ( ghaw\u0101z\u012b ) belonged to a single tribe and were usually considered little better than prostitutes. The erotic element in dancing became focused in the belly dance, which has become the leading form of exhibition dance in modern Turkey and the Arab countries.",
  "The mimetic tradition of folk dance has blended well with comedy in countries of the Sunni persuasion and with the passion-play tragedy in Shi\u02bfi countries. Yet in the late 20th century theatre was increasingly divorced from dance, most plays being consciously modeled on European patterns; only in the operetta does the old combination remain.",
  "In pre-Islamic times in Iran, dance was both an art form and a popular entertainment. There are pictures of dancers in miniatures, on pottery, and on walls, friezes, and coins. Some of the ancient dances lived on partially in tribal dances, but again, under Islam\u2019s restrictions on women, the art became a male monopoly. Women were permitted to dance in private, however, as in the harem. Iran is perhaps the only Muslim country with a tradition of dance regarded as an art form. When revived after World War II, folk dancing was encouraged and adapted for the foundation of a national ballet. Muslim orthodoxy\u2019s very uncertainty over the exact status of the artistic dance ensured that it was always considered as an adjunct to music. Accordingly, although there are many detailed treatises on Islamic music, none is available on dance.",
  "There is one outstanding example of pure dance: that of the whirling dervishes, an art that has been practiced since the 13th century. The procedure is part of a Muslim ceremony called the dhikr , the purpose of which is to glorify God and seek spiritual perfection. Not all dervish orders dance; some simply stand on one foot and move the other foot to music. Those who dance, or, rather, whirl, are the Mawlaw\u012b dervishes, an order that was founded by the Persian poet and mystic Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-R\u016bm\u012b at Konya, in Anatolia, in the 13th century.",
  "The performance, for which all the participants don tall conical hats and black mantles, takes place in a large hall in the tekke , the building in which the dervishes live. The dervishes sit in a circle listening to music. Then, rising slowly, they move to greet the shaykh , or master, and cast off the black coat to emerge in white shirts and waistcoats. They keep their individual places with respect to one another and begin to revolve rhythmically. They throw back their heads and raise the palms of their hands, a symbol of giving and taking. The rhythm accelerates, and they whirl faster and faster. In this way they enter a trance in an attempt to lose their personal identities and to attain union with the Almighty. Later they may sit, pray, and begin all over again. The dhikr ceremony always ends with a prayer and a procession.",
  "In lands where the Sunni sect was strong, mime shows were frequent and popular attractions during the later Middle Ages. The Ottoman sultans were accompanied on military campaigns by their own troupe of actors; and, as the Ottoman Empire grew larger and richer, the court became ever more partial to entertainment, whether at the accession of a sultan, a royal wedding, a circumcision, an official visit, or a victory. On such occasions, dances and theatrical performances played their part along with parades, fireworks, music, mock fights, and circus performances in one huge, sumptuous pageant. This lavishing of entertainment reached a height of splendour that the admiring Ottoman aristocracy strove to imitate throughout the empire. In Arabia and North Africa, popular shows on a lesser scale were performed in the open air. Another aspect of the Islamic theatre was represented in the shadow plays, which were given chiefly to pass the time during the month of fasting, Ramadan (the sacred ninth month of the Muslim year).",
  "Among the Shi\u02bfah the passion play ( ta\u02bfziyyah ) was regularly performed, by both professional and amateur actors. The performance always took place during the first 10 days of the month of Mu\u1e25arram (the first in the Muslim year), the period when the suffering and death of the descendants and relatives of the fourth caliph \u02bfAl\u012b were commemorated. For generations this largely theatrical event served as a focal point of the year, gripping audiences in total involvement with its blend of symbolism and realism.",
  "In the medieval Muslim theatre, mime shows aimed to entertain rather than to uplift their audiences. Regrettably, few mime shows were recorded in writing, and those that were recorded were set down primarily to serve as guidelines for directors, who might tamper with the wording, as in the improvisation of the Italian commedia dell\u2019arte . Some plays were on historical themes, but preference was for comedies or farces with an erotic flavour. The audience was largely composed of the poor and uneducated.",
  "A rudimentary theatrical form, the mime show long enjoyed widespread popularity in Anatolia and other parts of the Ottoman Empire. Called meddah (eulogist) or mukallit (imitator) in Turkish, the mimic had many similarities to his Classical Greek forerunners. Basically, he was a storyteller who used mimicry as a comic element, designed to appeal to his largely uneducated audience. By gesture and word he would imitate animals, birds, or local dialects; he was very popular in Arabic- and Turkish-speaking areas. Even today he has not been wholly supplanted in the Islamic world by literacy or by such modern entertainments as radio, television, and the cinema. Sometimes several meddah s performed together, and this may have been the source of a rural theatrical performance.",
  "The ortaoyunu (middle show) was the first type of genuine theatre the Turks, and possibly other Muslim peoples, ever had. The Ottoman sultans provided subsidies for ortaoyunu companies of actors, who consequently became generally accepted; also some were retained by the princes of the Romanian principalities under Ottoman rule. The fact that they continued to enjoy popularity to World War I may be explained by their simple dramatic appeal, which was coupled with sharp satire of the well-to-do and the ruling classes (but hardly ever of Islam). This irreverence frequently resulted in fines and imprisonment for the actors, but it never produced a basic change of style.",
  "During the 19th and 20th centuries the ortaoyunu was generally performed in an open square or a large coffeehouse. There was no stage, and props were simple: they generally comprised a table or movable screen, while other objects were represented by paintings glued on paper. An orchestra of about four musicians enlivened the show and gave the performers, who were all male, their cues. Roles were generally stereotyped, with stock characters, such as a dandy, the foreign physician, and regional types (Kurds, Albanians, Armenians, Arabs, and Jews) quarreling and fighting in slapstick style. Mimicry was important, and some actors changed roles and costumes. The plot was flimsy, a mere frame for the dialogue, which was itself frequently improvised.",
  "In comparison with ortaoyunu , the marionette theatre, although popular in Turkistan (under the name of \u00e7adir hay\u00e2l ) and other parts of Muslim Central Asia, never really caught on in the Ottoman Empire.",
  "  On the other hand, the shadow play had been widely popular for many centuries in Turkish- or Arabic-speaking countries. Its essence, like that of the mime shows, was entertainment without moral import, and few plays were recorded in writing beyond a sketch of the action. Most were comedies and farces that were performed for the enjoyment of an audience that was, for the most part, very poor and uneducated.",
  "In Turkey the Karag\u00f6z (a character whose name means \u201cblack-eye\u201d) theatre was the prevalent form of shadow play. This art apparently came from China or perhaps from Southeast Asia, as the French term ombres chinoises indeed hints, though the prevailing element of the grotesque was probably inherited from ancient Greece by way of Byzantium. The Karag\u00f6z was well known in Turkey during the 16th century but was so fully developed that it must have been introduced much earlier, and it quickly spread from Syria to North Africa and the Greek islands. Its performers were in great demand at the sultan\u2019s court as well as elsewhere, and they soon organized their own guild. Since only the framework of the play was sketched in writing, there was scope for a great deal of impromptu wit, and Karag\u00f6z shows, like the ortaoyunu , were inevitably satirical. But with the coming of motion pictures the Karag\u00f6z declined, and performances are now mostly confined to the month of Ramadan.",
  "In the traditional performance of the Karag\u00f6z, the stage is separated from the audience by a frame holding a sheet; the latter has shrunk over the years from about 6 by 7.5 feet (1.8 by 2.3 metres) to about 3 by 2 feet (0.9 by 0.6 metre). The puppets, which are flat and made of leather, are controlled by the puppeteers with rods and are placed behind the screen. An oil lamp is then placed still farther back so that it will throw the puppets\u2019 shadows onto the screen.",
  "A standard shadow play has three main elements: introduction, dialogue, and plot. The introduction is fairly stereotyped and consists of an argument and usually a quarrel between Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, the two most common characters. The former is a simple, commonsense fellow, while the latter is more formal and polished, if shallow and pedantic. The dialogue between the two varies with the occasion but always contains impromptu repartee, though most puppet masters have at least 28 different plots in stock\u2014a different one for each night of Ramadan. Some are historical, many ribald, but all are popular entertainment. Additional characters or animals may be introduced, calling for great skill on the part of the puppet master and his assistant in manipulating several simultaneously as well as in reciting the text in changing tones and playing music. Some have one or two musicians to help.",
  "Mimicry and caricature, while essential to both the meddah and the ortaoyunu , are technically more developed in the shadow play. Here entire productions are based on a comedy of manners or of character. In addition to the stock characters from various ethnic groups, there are, for example, the drug addict who wraps his narcotic in dissolving gum before the fast begins so as not to sin, the light-headed Turk (\u201che who eats his inheritance\u201d) who is a prodigal and a debauchee, the highway robber, the stutterer, and the policeman.",
  "Karag\u00f6z is the most frequently performed but not the sole type of shadow play in Muslim countries. In Egypt a shadow theatre is known to have existed as early as the 13th century, long before records of Karag\u00f6z shows were kept in Turkey. A physician, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn D\u0101niy\u0101l, wrote three shadow plays that have survived. They were performed in the 13th century and display humour and satire and the lampooning of matchmaking and marriage. These plays also introduce a parade of popular contemporary characters, many of whom earn their living in shady or amusing trades. A positively phallic element is as evident here as it is in the Karag\u00f6z.",
  "Popular theatre existed among the Iranians, who were proud of a long-lived cultural tradition and preserved their national language under Arab domination; indeed, even their branch of Islam, Shi\u02bfism, set them apart from the Sunni majority. The Ottomans\u2019 failure to conquer Iran increased competition between the respective intellectual elites. Iran had inherited a considerable theatrical tradition from pre-Islamic times, and it is not surprising that a popular comic theatre flourished there. The central figure of this type of theatre was the katchal pahlav\u0101n (\u201cbald actor\u201d), and mimicry was important, both in comedy and in pantomime. The baqqal-b\u0101z\u012b (\u201cgrocer play\u201d), in which a grocer repeatedly quarrels with his good-for-nothing servant, is a typical example of the popular comic tradition. The marionette theatre, or lobet-b\u0101z\u012b , while using Iranian puppets, was similar to its Turkish counterpart. At least five puppets appeared, and singing was an integral part of a production that sometimes resembled Italian and French puppet shows. The ortaoyunu , particularly in the region of Azerbaijan , is almost identical with the Turkish form of the same name. The shadow play in Iran, however, has always been less popular and obscene than the Ottoman or Arab Karag\u00f6z.",
  "Quite different was the passion play, derived mainly from early Islamic lore and assembled as a sequence of tragedies representing Shi\u02bfi martyrdom. Both the shadow play and the passion play were interlarded with musical prologues, accompaniment, and interludes, but these were not necessarily an integral part, serving rather to create a mood.",
  "A preoccupation with religion is characteristic of Persian theatrical performances, and, during the first 10 days of the month of Mu\u1e25arram, the martyrdom of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s descendants at the hands of the Umayyads is reenacted. Although these shows are also performed among Shi\u02bfi Turks in Central Asia and Shi\u02bfi Arab communities in Iraq and elsewhere, Iran is their centre. Some plays are satirical, directed against wrongdoers, but most form a set of tragedies, performed as passion plays on those 10 successive days. Named ta\u02bfziyyah , (\u201cconsolation\u201d), this type of drama is an expression of Persian patriotism and, above all, of piety, both elements combining in an expression of the national religion, Shi\u02bfism.",
  "In order to understand the mood of the ta\u02bfziyyah , it is necessary to remember that storytellers in Iran recite the gruesome details of the martyrdom of \u1e24asan, \u1e24usayn, and other descendants of \u02bfAl\u012b all year long. Thus prepared, people swell the street processions during the days of Mu\u1e25arram, chain themselves, flagellate their bodies, and pierce their limbs with needles, shouting in unison and carrying images of the martyrs\u2014made of straw and covered with blood\u2014contrary to the injunctions of Islam. Sometimes men walk in the processions with heads hidden and collars bloodied, all part of a pageant dating from the 9th or 10th century. Its peak is reached daily in the play describing the martyrdom of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s family and entourage, which used to be presented in the large mosques but, when the mosques proved too small, was given a special place. The roles of reciter of the martyrdom and of participant in a procession have blended over the years to produce the ta\u02bfziyyah play, in which the reciters march in procession to the appointed place and there recite their pieces, which can be considered as a prologue before the play itself begins.",
  "The chief incidents narrated in the ta\u02bfziyyah are not necessarily presented in chronological order, but in any case the ta\u02bfziyyah texts (manuscripts from the 17th and 18th centuries, thenceforth, printed texts) give an inadequate impression of their forceful effect. Indeed, the audience identifies itself so closely with the play that foreigners have, on occasion, been manhandled. Because half of the actors play the supporters of the \u02bfAlids and half play their opponents, the latter are sometimes attacked and beaten at the end of the play. The decor too is half realistic and half symbolic: blood is real, yet sand is represented by straw. The stage effects are frequently overdone, and this clearly further excites the audience. For instance, \u1e24usayn\u2019s gory head is made to recite holy verses, or an armless warrior is seen to kill his opponent with a sword he holds in his teeth. The horses are real, although most of the other animals are played by humans. In general, the actors, though chiefly nonprofessional, infect the audience with their enthusiasm and absorption.",
  "Insofar as dance is related to the modern theatre, there is little difference between Muslim production and its European or American counterpart. Dance and drama are combined according to the artistic needs of the production or the personal tastes of the producer and director. Perhaps more important is the dance itself, independently performed as artistic self-expression. The geographical centre of folk dance is in the area east of the Mediterranean, though remnants of other cultures have survived. There are Balkan traces in western and northern Turkey, for example, and Amazigh and even sub-Saharan African traces in Morocco and elsewhere in North Africa.",
  "In some Arab countries, dancing is popular, varying by town, village, or nomad tribe. In the towns, dancing is generally reserved for special occasions, chiefly Western social dances. On the other hand, villages have such favourites as the dabkah . The dabkah is danced mainly by men and is quite common in festivities in the area between northern Syria and southern Israel; for instance, the Druze (sectarian Arab communities located in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel) are very fond of it. The performers dance in a straight line, holding handkerchiefs high in the air, while the first dancer in the row gives the sign for stepping or jumping. Among the Bedouin almost any pretext suffices for dancing, although, since the mid-20th century, dancing has been practiced most often at weddings and similar festivities. Usually two male dancers, or two rows of male dancers, repeatedly advance toward each other or the audience and retire. Of this basic figure there are numerous variations that give the different dances their names.",
  "The Turks are also lovers of music and dance and frequently sing and dance when they meet. There is no single national dance popular throughout the country; dances vary in the numbers required, some being for solo performance, others designed for pairs or groups, though nearly all have instrumental accompaniment. As illustration of the possibilities of a basic step, there are at least 40 variations of the group dance known as bar , a chain dance. Again, several folk dances have characteristics akin to pantomime, breaking up into five main types of imitation: village life, nature, combat, courtship, and animals or birds.",
  "Opera is popular in Turkey, reflected in a long tradition of invitations to foreign companies, and the musical theatre, which frequently includes dancing, is also widespread. On the other hand, classical ballet was unknown until the late 20th century, when a school of ballet was opened by foreign teachers with government encouragement. Although most of the ballet performances are in Istanbul, they are well received on tour.",
  "In Iran a national dance company was formed with government support after World War II, and ancient customs were revived. Until it was closed in 1979, the Iranian ballet company was outstanding in the Muslim world, drawing on ancient war dances, fire-priest dances, dervish dances, and tribal folklore as well as on scenes and decor from painting, sculpture, and the rich imagery of classical Persian poetry. Various folk dances are likewise performed all over Iran; they are accompanied by music and reflect local traditions and customs. Some are mimetic, others erotic, others, again, war dances (chiefly in the mountain areas) and comic dances (usually with masks ). Many of these are dying out as new tastes and customs evolve, and Iranian dance companies have tried to preserve some of these dying forms.",
  "The modern Muslim theatre is almost wholly a western European importation, unconnected with the traditional medieval theatre, which has almost completely disappeared, although there are vestiges of it.",
  "Contemporary Arabic theatre owes much to the imaginative daring of the Naqq\u0101sh family in 19th-century Beirut, which was then under Turkish rule. Significantly, they were Christians, then better-educated and more cosmopolitan than Muslims, and they had the advantages of Beirut\u2019s contacts with Europe and position as the headquarters of missionary activity. A Beirut Maronite (a Roman Catholic following the Syrio-Antiochene rite, widespread in the area), M\u0101r\u016bn al-Naqq\u0101sh (died 1855), who knew French and Italian as well as Arabic and Turkish, adapted Moli\u00e8re\u2019s  L\u2019Avare (\u201cThe Miser\u201d) and presented it on a makeshift stage in Beirut in 1848. He did so before a select audience of foreign dignitaries and local notables, and he wrote his play in colloquial Arabic and revised the plot to suit the taste and views of his audience. Further, he changed the locale to an Arab town and Arabicized the names of the participants. Other touches included instrumental and vocal music and the playing of women\u2019s roles by men, in the traditional manner. The above features characterized the Arabic theatre for about half a century. Al-Naqq\u0101sh, together with his family, composed and presented two other musical plays, one based on Moli\u00e8re\u2019s Tartuffe , the other on the story, in The Thousand and One Nights , of Ab\u016b al-\u1e24asan, who became caliph for a day.",
  "Soon the main centre of Arabic theatre moved to Egypt, whose comparatively tolerant autonomy offered an atmosphere for literary and artistic creativity more congenial than other parts of the Ottoman Empire. Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals and actors emigrated there, particularly after the anti-Christian riots of 1860 in Syria. Though a somewhat crippled Arabic theatre continued in Syria, its influence was carried into Egypt by \u00e9migr\u00e9s and later spread to other Arabic-speaking regions. The number of theatres, a potentially large public, the munificence of Egypt\u2019s rulers, increasing prosperity under British rule after 1882, and increasing education soon made Egypt the centre of Arabic theatre, a position it has successfully maintained since.",
  "The colloquial Arabic of Egypt was increasingly employed in the theatre, and several companies toured the country and neighbouring parts. The composition of those companies was fluid, for the actors were prone to be fickle in their loyalties. Nevertheless, certain types of Egyptian theatre can be discerned in the late 19th century and during the early 20th. Some, like the company of Sal\u0101mah \u1e24ij\u0101z\u012b, used music to such an extent that their productions approached being labelled opera or operetta . Others, like that of \u02bfAl\u012b al-Kass\u0101r, specialized in downright farce, expressed in revue form, with a Nubian hero, the \u201cBarbarin,\u201d who made a specialty of ridicule and mimicry. Yet others, like the company of Naj\u012bb al-R\u012b\u1e25\u0101n\u012b, oscillating between outright farce and comedy, skillfully depicted contemporary Egyptian manners; in particular, Naj\u012bb al-R\u012b\u1e25\u0101n\u012b created a character called Kish-Kish Bey, whose misadventures and unsolicited advice on every subject made him a classic creation. A conventional theatre sprang up in Egypt too, catering to a growing number of intellectuals and presenting dramas and tragedies in polished, literary Arabic. Its chief exponent was J\u016brj Abya\u1e0d, who had spent time studying acting in Paris. In contrast, Y\u016bsuf Wahb\u012b\u2019s National Troupe performed realistic plays, usually dramas or melodramas, using either colloquial or literary Arabic and sometimes a combination of both.",
  "The plays performed by the Egyptian troupes and others in Arabic-speaking lands developed through three overlapping but distinguishable stages: adaptations, translations, and original plays. Adaptations came first in the 19th century ( see above ). Translations of established works appealed to a discriminating public, but original plays, part of the evolution of modern Arabic literature, reflected a growing interest in political and social problems. The decline of foreign influence and the arrival of political independence encouraged creativity, which, however much under European influence, has some original works to its credit. Two 20th-century Arabic playwrights, both Egyptian, were Tawf\u012bq al-\u1e24ak\u012bm , a sensitive shaper of both social and symbolic dramas, and Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Taym\u016br, a novelist and comedy writer who struck deep into Egypt\u2019s social problems.",
  "The development of the modern Turkish theatre strongly resembles its Arabic counterpart. In Istanbul, theatrical performances were not unusual among the diplomatic and international set, and some local Turks were acquainted with them. Nonetheless, Turkish plays for live actors\u2014barring ortaoyunu \u2014date only from 1839. The first Turkish playhouse was built in Pera (now Beyo\u011flu), significantly in the middle of the foreign and embassy quarter of Istanbul. Many of the actors were members of non-Muslim minorities, such as Armenians, and the first plays presented in Turkish were adaptations from the French, chiefly Moli\u00e8re. They were done during the 1840s, when music was an important item.",
  "The Gedik Pa\u015fa Theatre, named for the area in Istanbul where it was located, was the first theatre in which Turkish plays were produced by native actors speaking in Turkish. The actors received a salary, and local writers presented their own plays. Originally built for foreign companies, the theatre was reconstructed in 1867 and reopened in 1868 for a Turkish company headed by an Armenian, Agop, who was later converted to Islam and changed his name to Yakup. For almost 20 years the Gedik Pa\u015fa Theatre was the dramatic centre of the city. Plays in translation were soon followed by original plays, several with a nationalist appeal, such as Nam\u0131k Kemal\u2019s Vatan yahut Silistre (\u201cFatherland\u201d), which was first produced in 1873. The actors had to struggle against prejudice and the playwrights against censorship (some of them were imprisoned or exiled), but the Turkish theatre spread beyond Istanbul in the 1870s and \u201980s to such places as Adana (in southern Anatolia) and Bursa (just south of Istanbul, across the Sea of Marmara ).",
  "After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, censorship was not relaxed, but interest in the theatre grew, particularly over political matters, and plays about the new constitution were written and performed. After the foundation of the Turkish republic in 1923, the state subsidized several theatre companies and a school for dramatic arts, and an opera house was built in Ankara. Official support not only gave financial encouragement but also implied a change of attitude over such matters as the participation of Muslim women in productions.",
  "By the middle of the 20th century, theatrical life was mostly centred on Istanbul and Ankara, although theatres and companies continued in the small towns too. A growing number of original plays, some of which were influenced by American literature, have been written and produced; the standard has been higher than it was before World War I, when Turkish poetry and fiction were rather more impressive than the drama. Subjects, too, have been more diverse since that time. To topics such as the position of women, marriage and divorce, and the character of Islamic institutions\u2014all popular under the Ottomans\u2014have been added the Greco-Turkish wars , education, village conditions, secularization, class struggle, and psychological problems. The Dormen Theatre was founded in Istanbul in 1955 by Haldun Dormen; in the 1971 World Theatre season in London the company performed A Tale of Istanbul , a comedy that included elements of folklore, a puppet show, singing, and a belly dance. The Dormen Theatre also produced modern Western plays.",
  "In Iran the birth of the modern theatre dates from the second half of the 19th century. Adaptations and translations from European plays appeared in Persian, often with the location and names suited to Iran. Moli\u00e8re again was a favourite and western European influence considerable, though Russian literature also left its mark.",
  "Playwrights began to write original plays almost at once; one of the earliest playwrights was an Azerbaijani, named Akhundof, living in the Caucasus. He wrote seven comedies ridiculing Persian and Caucasian Muslim society; all were translated into Persian and printed in 1874. Other plays likewise showed pronounced yearnings for social reform presented in a satirical style; some of those were published in a magazine called Tyatr (\u201cTheatre\u201d), which first appeared in 1908. Another type was the patriotic play, extolling Iran\u2019s history.",
  "Some pre-World War I pieces were designed for reading rather than production. They were performed usually in schools, but there were hardly any professional actors, and the stage and props were very simple. After World War I, suitable halls were built in Tehr\u0101n and other cities, but the iron hand of Reza Shah (1925\u201341) curtailed development through continuous censorship and surveillance. After 1942 many new companies were formed, and there was speedy development, with growing interest in social and political subjects, though competition from foreign films was considerable. The revolutionary Islamic regime established in 1979 severely curtailed theatrical activity.",
  "In order to answer whether there is an aesthetic, iconographic, or stylistic unity to the visually perceptible arts of Islamic peoples, it is first essential to realize that no ethnic or geographical entity was Muslim from the beginning. There is no Islamic art, therefore, in the way there is a Chinese art or a French art. Nor is it simply a period art, like Gothic art or Baroque art, for once a land or an ethnic entity became Muslim, it remained Muslim, a small number of exceptions such as Spain or Sicily notwithstanding. Political and social events transformed a number of lands with a variety of earlier histories into Muslim lands. But because early Islam as such did not possess or propagate an art of its own, each area could continue, in fact often did continue, whatever modes of creativity it had acquired. It may then not be appropriate at all to talk about the visual arts of Islamic peoples, and one should instead consider separately each of the areas that became Muslim: Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Iran, Anatolia, and India. Such, in fact, has been the direction taken by some scholarship. Even though tainted at times with parochial nationalism, that approach has been useful in that it has focused attention on a number of permanent features in different regions of Islamic lands that are older than and independent from the faith itself and from the political entity created by it. Iranian art, in particular, exhibits a number of features (certain themes such as the representation of birds or an epic tradition in painting) that owe little to its Islamic character since the 7th century. Ottoman art shares a Mediterranean tradition of architectural conception with Italy rather than with the rest of the Muslim world.",
  "Such examples can easily be multiplied, but it is probably wrong to overstate their importance. For if one looks at the art of Islamic lands from a different perspective, a totally different picture emerges. The perspective is that of the lands that surround the Muslim world or of the times that preceded its formation. For even if there are ambiguous examples, most observers can recognize a flavour, a mood in Islamic visual arts that is distinguishable from what is known in East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) or in the Christian West. This mood or flavour has been called decorative, for it seems at first glance to emphasize an immense complexity of surface effects without apparent meanings attached to the visible motifs. But it has other characteristics as well: it is often colourful, both in architecture and in objects; it avoids representations of living things; it gives much prominence to the work of artisans and counts among its masterpieces not merely works of architecture or of painting but also the creations of weavers, potters, and metalworkers. The problem is whether these uniquenesses of Islamic art, when compared with other artistic traditions, are the result of the nature of Islam or of some other factor or series of factors.",
  "These preliminary remarks suggest at the very outset the main epistemological peculiarity of Islamic art: it consists of a large number of quite disparate traditions that, when seen all together, appear distinguishable from what surrounded them and from what preceded them through a series of stylistic and thematic characteristics. The key question is how this was possible, but no answer can be given before the tradition itself has been properly defined.",
  "Such a definition can be provided only in history, through an examination of the formation and development of the arts through the centuries, for a static sudden phenomenon is not being dealt with, but rather a slow building up of a visual language of forms with many dialects and with many changes. Whether these complexities of growth and development subsumed a common structure is the challenging question facing the historian of this artistic tradition. What makes the question particularly difficult to answer is that the study of Islamic art is still so new. Many monuments are unpublished or at least insufficiently known, and only a handful of scientific excavations have investigated the physical setting of the culture and of its art. Much, therefore, remains tentative in the knowledge and appreciation of works of Islamic art, and what follows is primarily an outline of what is known, with a number of suggestions for further work into insufficiently investigated areas.",
  "  Each artistic tradition has tended to develop its own favourite mediums and techniques. Some, of course, such as architecture, are automatic needs of every culture; and, for reasons to be developed later, it is in the medium of architecture that some of the most characteristically Islamic works of art are found. Other techniques, on the other hand, acquire varying forms and emphases. Sculpture in the round hardly existed as a major art form, and, although such was also the case of all Mediterranean arts at the time of Islam\u2019s growth, one does not encounter the astounding rebirth of sculpture that occurred in the West. Wall painting existed but has generally been poorly preserved; the great Islamic art of painting was limited to the illustration of books. The unique feature of Islamic techniques is the astounding development taken by the so-called decorative arts\u2014e.g., woodwork, glass, ceramics, metalwork, and textiles. New techniques were invented and spread throughout the Muslim world\u2014at times even beyond its frontiers. In dealing with Islam, therefore, it is quite incorrect to think of those techniques as the \u201cminor\u201d arts, for the amount and intensity of creative energies spent on the decorative arts transformed them into major artistic forms, and their significance in defining a profile of the aesthetic and visual language of Islamic peoples is far greater than in the instances of many other cultures. Furthermore, because, for a variety of reasons to be discussed later, the Muslim world did not develop until quite late the notion of \u201cnoble\u201d arts, the decorative arts have reflected far better the needs and ambitions of the culture as a whole. The kind of conclusion that can be reached about Islamic civilization through its visual arts thus extends far deeper than is usual in the study of an artistic tradition, and it requires a combination of archaeological, art-historical, and textual information.",
  "An example may suffice to demonstrate the point. Among all the techniques of Islamic visual arts, the most important one was the art of textiles. Textiles, of course, were used for daily wear at all social levels and for all occasions. But clothes were also the main indicators of rank, and they were given as rewards or as souvenirs by princes, high and low. They were a major status symbol, and their manufacture and distribution were carefully controlled through a complicated institution known as the \u1e6dir\u0101z . Major events were at times celebrated by being depicted on silks. Many texts have been identified that describe the hundreds of different kinds of textiles that existed. Because textiles could easily be moved, they became a vehicle for the transmission of artistic themes within the Muslim world and beyond its frontiers. In the case of this one technique, therefore, one is dealing not simply with a medium of the decorative arts but with a key medium in the definition of a given time\u2019s taste, of its practical functions, and of the ways in which its ideas were distributed. The more unfortunate point is that the thousands of fragments that have remained have not yet been studied in a sufficiently systematic way, and in only a handful of instances has it been possible to relate individual fragments to known texts. When more work has been completed, however, a study of this one medium should contribute significantly to the commercial, social, and aesthetic history of Islam, as well as explain much of the impact that Islamic art had beyond the frontiers of the Muslim world.",
  "The following survey of Islamic visual arts, therefore, will be primarily a historical one, for it is in development through time that the main achievements of Islamic art can best be understood. At the same time, other features peculiar to this tradition will be kept in mind: the varying importance of different lands, each of which had identifiable artistic features of its own, and the uniqueness of certain creative techniques.",
  "Islamic visual arts were created by the confluence of two entirely separate kinds of phenomena: a number of earlier artistic traditions and a new faith. The arts inherited by Islam were of extraordinary technical virtuosity and stylistic or iconographic variety. All the developments of arcuated and vaulted architecture that had taken place in Iran and in the Roman Empire were available in their countless local variants. Stone, baked brick, mud brick, and wood existed as mediums of construction, and all the complicated engineering systems developed particularly in the Roman Empire were still utilized from Spain to the Euphrates. All the major techniques of decoration were still used, except for monumental sculpture. In secular and in religious art, a more or less formally accepted equivalence between representation and represented subject had been established. Technically, therefore, as well as ideologically, the Muslim world took over an extremely sophisticated system of visual forms; and, because the Muslim conquest was accompanied by a minimum of destruction, all the monuments, and especially the attitudes attached to them, were passed on to the new culture.",
  "The second point about the pre-Islamic traditions is the almost total absence of anything from Arabia itself. While archaeological work in the peninsula may modify this conclusion in part, it does seem that Islamic art formed itself entirely in some sort of relationship to non-Arab traditions. Even the rather sophisticated art created in earlier times by the Palmyrenes or by the Nabataeans had almost no impact on Islamic art, and the  \u1e25aram  in Mecca , the only pre-Islamic sanctuary maintained by the new faith, remained as a unique monument that was almost never copied or imitated despite its immense religious significance. The pre-Islamic sources of Islamic art are thus entirely extraneous to the milieu in which the new faith was created. In this respect the visual arts differ considerably from most other aspects of Islamic culture.",
  "This is not to say that there was no impact of the new faith on the arts, but to a large extent it was an incidental impact, the result of the existence of a new social and political entity rather than of a doctrine. Earliest Islam as seen in the Qur\u02be\u0101n or in the more verifiable accounts of the Prophet \u2019s life simply do not deal with the arts, either on the practical level of requiring or suggesting forms as expressions of the culture or on the ideological level of defining a Muslim attitude toward images. In all instances, concrete Qur\u02be\u0101nic passages later used for the arts had their visual significance extrapolated.",
  "There is no prohibition against representations of living things, and not a single Qur\u02be\u0101nic passage refers clearly to the mosque , eventually to become the most characteristically Muslim religious building. In the simple, practical, and puritanical milieu of early Islam, aesthetic or visual questions simply did not arise.",
  "The impact of the faith on the arts occurred rather as the fledgling culture encountered the earlier non-Islamic world and sought to justify its own acceptance or rejection of new ways and attitudes. The discussion of two examples of particular significance illustrates the point. One is the case of the mosque. The word itself derives from the Arabic masjid , \u201ca place where one prostrates oneself (in front of God).\u201d It was a common term in pre-Islamic Arabic and in the Qur\u02be\u0101n, where it is applied to sanctuaries in general without restriction. If a more concrete significance was meant, the word was used in construct with some other term, as in masjid al-\u1e25aram to refer to the Meccan sanctuary. There was no need in earliest times for a uniquely Muslim building, for any place could be used for private prayer as long as the correct direction ( qiblah , originally Jerusalem but very soon Mecca) was observed and the proper sequence of gestures and pious statements was followed. In addition to private prayer, which had no formal setting, Islam instituted a collective prayer on Fridays, where the same ritual was accompanied by a sermon from the imam (leader of prayer, originally the Prophet, then his successors, and later legally any able-bodied Muslim) and by the more complex ceremony of the khu\u1e6dbah , a collective swearing of allegiance to the community\u2019s leadership. This ceremony served to strengthen the common bond between all members of the ummah , the Muslim \u201ccollectivity,\u201d and its importance in creating and maintaining the unity of early Islam has often been emphasized. There were two traditional locales for this event in the Prophet\u2019s time. One was his private house, whose descriptions have been preserved; it was a large open space with private rooms on one side and rows of palm trunks making a colonnade on two other sides, the deeper colonnade being on the side of the qiblah . The Prophet\u2019s house was not a sanctuary but simply the most convenient place for the early community to gather. Far less is known about the second place of gathering for the Muslim community. It was used primarily on major feast days, such as the end of the fasting period or the feast of sacrifice. It was called a mu\u1e63all\u0101 , literally \u201ca place for prayer,\u201d and mu\u1e63all\u0101 s were usually located outside city walls. Nothing is known about the shape taken by mu\u1e63all\u0101 s, but in all probability they were as simple as pre-Islamic pagan sanctuaries: large enclosures surrounded by a wall and devoid of any architectural or ornamental feature.",
  "Altogether then there was hardly anything that could be identified as a holy building or as an architectural form. To be complete, one should add two additional features. One is an action, the call to prayer (  adh\u0101n  ). It became, fairly rapidly, a formal moment preceding the gathering of the faithful. One man would climb on the roof and proclaim that God is great and that men must congregate to pray. There was no formal monument attached to the ceremony, though it led eventually to the ubiquitous minaret . The other early feature was an actual structure. It was the minbar , a chair with several steps on which the Prophet would climb in order to preach. The monument itself had a pre-Islamic origin, but Muhammad transformed it into a characteristically Muslim form.",
  "With the exception of the minbar , only a series of actions were formulated in early Islamic times. There were no forms attached to them, nor were any needed. But, as the Muslim world grew in size, the contact with many other cultures brought about two developments. On the one hand, there were thousands of examples of beautiful religious buildings that impressed the conquering Arabs. But, more important, the need arose to preserve the restricted uniqueness of the community of faithful and to express its separateness from other groups. Islamic religious architecture began with this need and, in ways to be described later, created a formal setting for the activities, ceremonies, and ideas that had been formless at the outset.",
  "A second and closely parallel development of the impact of the Islamic religion on the visual arts is the celebrated question of a Muslim iconoclasm. As has already been mentioned, the Qur\u02be\u0101n does not utter a word for or against the representation of living things. It is equally true that from about the middle of the 8th century a prohibition had been formally stated, and thenceforth it would be a standard feature of Islamic thought, even though the form in which it is expressed has varied from absolute to partial and even though it has never been totally followed. The justification for the prohibition tended to be that any representation of a living thing was an act of competition with God, for he alone can create something that is alive. It is striking that this theological explanation reflects the state of the arts in the Christian world at the time of the Muslim conquest\u2014a period of iconoclastic controversy . It may thus be suggested that Islam developed an attitude toward images as it came into contact with other cultures and that its attitude was negative because the arts of the time appeared to lead easily to dreaded idolatry. While it is only by the middle of the 8th century that there is actual proof of the existence of a Muslim doctrine, it is likely that, more or less intuitively, the Muslims felt a certain reluctance toward representations from the very beginning. For all monuments of religious art are devoid of any representations; even a number of attempts at representational symbolism in the official art of coinage were soon abandoned.",
  "  This rapid crystallization of Islamic attitudes toward images has considerable significance. For practical purposes, representations are not found in religious art, although matters are quite different in secular art. Instead there occurred very soon a replacement of imagery with calligraphy and the concomitant transformation of calligraphy into a major artistic medium. Furthermore, the world of Islam tended to seek means of representing the holy other than by images of human beings, and one of the main problems of interpretation of Islamic art is that of the degree of means it achieved in this search. But there is a deeper aspect to this rejection of holy images. Although the generally Semitic or specifically Jewish sources that have been given to Islamic iconoclasms have probably been exaggerated, the reluctance imposed by the circumstances of the 7th century transformed into a major key of artistic creativity the magical fear of visual imagery that exists in all cultures but that is usually relegated to a secondary level. This uniqueness is certainly one of the main causes of the abstract tendencies that are among the great glories of the tradition. Even when a major art of painting did develop, it remained always somehow secondary to the mainstream of the culture\u2019s development.",
  "Both in the case of the religious building and in that of the representations, therefore, it was the contact with pre-Islamic cultures in Muslim-conquered areas that compelled Islam to transform its practical and unique needs into monuments and to seek within itself for intellectual and theological justifications for its own instincts. The great strength of early Islam was that it possessed within itself the ideological means to put together a visual expression of its own, even though it did not develop at the very beginning a need for such an expression.",
  "One last point can be made about the origins of Islamic art. It concerns the degree of importance taken by the various artistic and cultural entities conquered by the Arabs in the 7th and 8th centuries, for the early empire had gathered in regions that had not been politically or even ideologically related for centuries. During the first century or two of Islam, the main models and the main sources of inspiration were certainly the Christian centres around the Mediterranean. But the failure to capture Constantinople (now Istanbul ) and to destroy the Byzantine Empire also made those Christian centres inimical competitors, whereas the whole world of Iran became an integral part of the empire, even though the conquering Arabs were far less familiar with the latter than with the former. A much more complex problem is posed by conversions, for it is through the success of the militant Muslim religious mission that the culture expanded so rapidly. Insofar as one can judge, it is the common folk, primarily in cities, who took over the new faith most rapidly; and there thus was added in early Islamic culture a folk element whose impact may have been larger than has hitherto been imagined.",
  "Those preliminary considerations on the origins of Islamic art have made it possible to outline several of the themes and problems that remained constant features of the tradition: a self-conscious sense of uniqueness when compared with others; a continuous reference to its own Qur\u02be\u0101nic sources; a constant relationship to many different cultures; a folk element; and a variety of regional developments. None of those features remained constant, not even those aspects of the faith that affected the arts. But while they changed, the fact of their existence, their structural presence, remained a constant of Islamic art.",
  "Of all the recognizable periods of Islamic art, this is by far the most difficult one to explain properly, even though it is quite well documented. There are two reasons for this difficulty. On the one hand, it was a formative period, a time when new forms were created that identify the aesthetic and practical ideals of the new culture. Such periods are difficult to define when, as in the case of Islam, there was no artistic need inherent to the culture itself. The second complication derives from the fact that Muslim conquest hardly ever destroyed former civilizations with its own established creativity. Material culture, therefore, continued as before, and archaeologically it is almost impossible to distinguish between pre-Islamic and early Islamic artifacts. Paradoxical though it may sound, there is an early Islamic Christian art of Syria and Egypt, and in many other regions the parallel existence of a Muslim and a non-Muslim art continued for centuries. What did happen during early Islamic times, however, was the establishment of a dominant new taste, and it is the nature and character of this taste that has to be explained. It occurred first in Syria and Iraq, the two areas with the largest influx of Muslims and with the two successive capitals of the empire, Damascus under the Umayyads and Baghdad under the early Abbasids. From Syria and Iraq this new taste spread in all directions and adapted itself to local conditions and local materials, thus creating considerable regional and chronological variations in early Islamic art.",
  "From a historical point of view, two major dynasties are involved. One is the Umayyad dynasty , which ruled from 661 to 750 and whose monuments are datable from 680 to 745. It was the only Muslim dynasty ever to control the whole of the Islamic-conquered world. The second dynasty is the Abbasid dynasty ; technically its rule extended as late as 1258, but in reality its princes ceased to be a significant cultural factor after the second decade of the 10th century. The Abbasids no longer controlled Spain , where an independent Umayyad caliphate had been established ( see  Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba ); and in Egypt as well as in northeastern Iran a number of more or less independent dynasties appeared, such as the \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnids or the Samanids . Although research in the late 20th century tended to make the conclusion less certain than it used to be for the Samanids and northeast Iran, the initial impulse for the artistic creativity of those dynasties came from the main Abbasid centres in Iraq. While in detailed studies it is possible to distinguish between Umayyad and Abbasid art or between the arts of various provinces, the key features of the first three centuries of Islamic art (roughly through the middle of the 10th century) are the interplay between local or imperial impulses and the creation of new forms and functions.",
  "It is possible to study those centuries as a succession of clusters of monuments, but, because there are so many of them, a study can easily end up as an endless list. It is preferable, therefore, to centre the discussion of Umayyad and Abbasid monuments on the functional and morphological characteristics that identify the new Muslim world and only secondarily be concerned with stylistic progression or regional differences.",
  "The one obviously new function developed during this period is that of the mosque, or masjid . The earliest adherents of Islam used the private house of the Prophet in Medina as the main place for their religious and other activities and mu\u1e63all\u0101 s without established forms for certain holy ceremonies. The key phenomenon of the first decades that followed the conquest is the creation outside Arabia of masjid s in every centre taken over by the new faith. These were not simply or even primarily religious centres. They were rather the community centres of the faithful, in which all social, political, educational, and individual affairs were transacted. Among those activities were common prayer and the ceremony of the  khu\u1e6dbah  . The first mosques were built primarily to serve as the restricted space in which the new community would make its own collective decisions. It is there that the treasury of the community was kept, and early accounts are full of anecdotes about the immense variety of events, from the dramatic to the scabrous, that took place in mosques. Since even in earliest times the Muslim community consisted of several superimposed and interconnected social systems, mosques reflected this complexity, and, next to large mosques for the whole community, tribal mosques and mosques for various quarters of a town or city are also known.",
  "None of those early mosques has survived, and no descriptions of the smaller ones have been preserved. There do remain, however, accurate textual descriptions of the large congregational buildings erected at K\u016bfah and Basra in Iraq and at Al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d in Egypt. At K\u016bfah a larger square was marked out by a ditch, and a covered colonnade known as a \u1e93ullah (a shady place) was put up on the qiblah side. In 670 a wall pierced by many doors was built in place of the ditch, and colonnades were put up on all four sides, with a deeper one on the qiblah . In all probability the Basra mosque was very similar, and only minor differences distinguished the \u02bfAmr ibn al-\u02bf\u0100\u1e63 mosque at Al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d. Much has been written about the sources of this type of building, but the simplest explanation may be that this is the very rare instance of the actual creation of a new architectural type. The new faith\u2019s requirement for centralization, or a space for a large and constantly growing community, could not be met by any existing architectural form. Almost accidentally, therefore, the new Muslim cities of Iraq created the hypostyle mosque (a building with the roof resting on rows of columns ). A flexible architectural unit, a hypostyle structure could be square or rectangular and could be increased or diminished in size by the addition or subtraction of columns. The single religious or symbolic feature of the hypostyle mosque was a minbar (a pulpit) for the preacher, and the direction of prayer was indicated by the greater depth of the colonnade on one side of the structure.",
  "The examples of K\u016bfah, Basra, and Al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d are particularly clear because they were all built in newly created cities. Matters are somewhat more complex when discussing the older urban centres taken over by Muslims. Although it is not possible to generalize with any degree of certainty, two patterns seem to emerge. In some cases, such as Jerusalem and Damascus and perhaps in most cities conquered through formal treaties, the Muslims took for themselves an available unused space and erected on it some shelter. In Jerusalem this space happened to be a particularly holy one\u2014the area of the Jewish temple built by Herod the Great , which had been left willfully abandoned and ruined by the triumphant Christian empire. In Damascus it was a section of a huge Roman temple area, on another part of which there was a church dedicated to St. John the Baptist . Unfortunately, too little is known about other cities to be able to demonstrate that this pattern was a common one. The very same uncertainty surrounds the second pattern, which consisted in forcibly transforming sanctuaries of older faiths into Muslim ones. This was the case at \u1e24am\u0101h in Syria and at Yazd-e Khv\u0101st in Iran, where archaeological proof exists of the change. There are also several literary references to the fact that Christian churches, Zoroastrian fire temples, and other older abandoned sanctuaries were transformed into mosques. Altogether, however, those instances probably were not too numerous, because in most places the Muslim conquerors were quite eager to preserve local tradition and because few older sanctuaries could easily serve the primary Muslim need of a large centralizing space.",
  "During the 50 years that followed the beginning of the Muslim conquest, the mosque, until then a very general concept in Islamic thought, became a definite building reserved for a variety of needs required by the community of faithful in any one settlement. Only in one area, Iraq, did the mosque acquire a unique form of its own, the oriented hypostyle. Neither in Iraq nor elsewhere is there evidence of symbolic or functional components in mosque design. The only exception is that of the maq\u1e63\u016brah (literally \u201cclosed-off space\u201d), an enclosure, probably in wood, built near the centre of the qiblah wall. Its purpose was to protect the caliph or his replacement, for several attacks against major political figures had taken place. But the maq\u1e63\u016brah was never destined to be a constant fixture of mosques, and its typological significance is limited.",
  "  During the rule of the Umayyad prince al-Wal\u012bd I (705\u2013715), a number of complex developments within the Muslim community were crystallized in the construction of three major mosques\u2014at Medina , Jerusalem, and Damascus. The very choice of those three cities is indicative: the city in which the Muslim state was formed and in which the Prophet was buried; the city held in common holiness by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, to which was rapidly accruing the mystical hagiography surrounding the Prophet\u2019s ascension into heaven; and the ancient city that became the capital of the new Islamic empire. A first and essential component of al-Wal\u012bd\u2019s mosques was thus their imperial character; they were to symbolize the permanent establishment of the new faith and of the state that derived from it. They were no longer purely practical shelters but willful monuments.",
  "Although the plans of Al-Aq\u1e63\u0101 Mosque in Jerusalem and of the mosque of Medina can be reconstructed with a fair degree of certainty, only the one at Damascus has been preserved with comparatively minor alterations and repairs. In plan the three buildings appear at first glance to be quite different from each other. The Medina mosque was essentially a large hypostyle with a courtyard. The colonnades on all four sides were of varying depth. Al-Aq\u1e63\u0101 Mosque consisted of an undetermined number of naves (possibly as many as 15) parallel to each other in a north-south direction. There was no courtyard, because the rest of the huge esplanade of the former Jewish temple served as the open space in front of the building. The Umayyad Mosque of Damascus is a rectangle 515 by 330 feet (157 by 100 metres) whose outer limits and three gates are parts of a Roman temple (a fourth Roman gate on the qiblah side was blocked). The interior consists of an open space surrounded on three sides by a portico and of a covered space of three equal long naves parallel to the qiblah wall that are cut in the middle by a perpendicular nave.",
  "The three buildings share several important characteristics. They are all large spaces with a multiplicity of internal supports, and although only the Medina mosque is a pure hypostyle, the Jerusalem and Damascus mosques have the flexibility and easy internal communication characteristic of a hypostyle building. All three mosques exhibit a number of distinctive new practical elements and symbolic meanings. Many of those occur in all mosques; others are known in only some of them. The mihrab, for example, appears in all mosques. This is a niche of varying size that tends to be heavily decorated. It occurs in the qiblah wall, and, in all probability, its purpose was to commemorate the symbolic presence of the Prophet as the first imam, although there are other explanations. It is in Damascus only that the ancient towers of the Roman building were first used as minarets to call the faithful to prayer and to indicate from afar the presence of Islam (initially minarets tended to exist only in predominantly non-Muslim cities). All three mosques are also provided with an axial nave, a wider aisle unit on the axis of the building, which served both as a formal axis for compositional purposes and as a ceremonial one for the prince\u2019s retinue. Finally, all three buildings were heavily decorated with marble, mosaics, and woodwork. At least in the mosque of Damascus, it is further apparent that there was careful concern for the formal composition\u2014a balance between parts that truly makes this mosque a work of art. This is particularly evident in the successful relationship established between the open space of the court and the facade of the covered qiblah side.",
  "When compared with the first Muslim buildings of Iraq and Egypt, the monuments of al-Wal\u012bd are characterized by the growing complexity of their forms, by the appearance of uniquely Muslim symbolic and functional features, and by the quality of their construction. While the dimensions, external appearance, and proportions of any one of them were affected in each case by unique local circumstances, the internal balance between open and covered areas and the multiplicity of simple and flexible supports indicate the permanence of the early hypostyle tradition.",
  " ce  Either in its simplest form, as in Medina, or in its more-formalized shape, as in Damascus, the hypostyle tradition dominated mosque architecture from 715 to the 10th century. As it occurs at N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br (Neysh\u0101b\u016br) in northeastern Iran, S\u012br\u0101f in southern Iran, Kairouan in Tunisia, and C\u00f3rdoba in Spain, it can indeed be considered as the classic early Islamic type. Its masterpieces occur in Iraq and in the West. The monumentalization of the early Iraqi hypostyle is illustrated by the two ruined structures in S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be , with their enormous sizes (790 by 510 feet [240 by 156 metres] for one and 700 by 440 feet [213 by 135 metres] for the other), their multiple entrances, their complex piers, and, in one instance, a striking separation of the qiblah area from the rest of the building. The best-preserved example of this type is the Mosque of A\u1e25mad ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn at Cairo (876\u2013879), where a semi-independent governor, A\u1e25mad ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn , introduced Iraqi techniques and succeeded in creating a masterpiece of composition.",
  "  Two classic examples of early mosques in the western Islamic world of interest are preserved in Tunisia and Spain. In Kairouan the Great Mosque was built in stages between 836 and 866. Its most striking feature is the formal emphasis on the building\u2019s T-like axis punctuated by two domes, one of which hovers over the earliest preserved ensemble of mihrab, minbar , and maq\u1e63\u016brah . At C\u00f3rdoba the earliest section of the Great Mosque was built in 785\u2013786. It consisted simply of 11 naves with a wider central one and a court. It was enlarged twice in length, first between 833 and 855 and again from 961 to 965 (it was in the latter phase that the celebrated maq\u1e63\u016brah and mihrab, composing one of the great architectural ensembles of early Islamic art, were constructed). Finally, in 987\u2013988 an extension of the mosque was completed to the east that increased its size by almost one-third without destroying its stylistic unity. The constant increases in the size of this mosque are a further illustration of the flexibility of the hypostyle and its adaptability to any spatial requirement. The most memorable aspects of the C\u00f3rdoba mosque, however, lie in its construction and decoration. The particularly extensive and heavily decorated mihrab area exemplifies a development that started with the Medina mosque and would continue: an emphasis on the qiblah wall.",
  "Although the hypostyle mosque was the dominant plan, it was not the only one. From very early Islamic times, a fairly large number of aberrant plans also occur. Most of them were built in smaller urban locations or were secondary mosques in larger Muslim cities. It is rather difficult, therefore, to evaluate whether their significance was purely local or they were important for the tradition as a whole. Because a simple type of square subdivided by four piers into nine-domed units occurs at Balkh in Afghanistan, at Cairo, and at Toledo , it may be considered a pan-Islamic type. Other types, a single square hall surrounded by an ambulatory, or a single long barrel-vault parallel or perpendicular to the qiblah , are rarer and should perhaps be considered as purely local. These are particularly numerous in Iran, where it does seem that the mainstream of early Islamic architecture did not penetrate very deeply. Unfortunately, the archaeological exploration of Iran is still in its infancy, and many of the mud-brick buildings from the early Islamic period have been destroyed or rebuilt beyond recognition. As a result, it is extremely difficult to determine the historical importance of monuments found at Neyr\u012bz, Mo\u1e25ammad\u012byeh (near N\u0101\u02be\u012bn), Fahraj (near Yazd), or Hazareh (near Samarkand). For an understanding of the mosque\u2019s development and of the general dynamics of Islamic architecture, however, an awareness of those secondary types, which may have existed outside Iran as well, is essential.",
  "The function of the mosque, the central gathering place of the Muslim community, became the major and most original completely Muslim architectural effort. The mosque was not a purely religious building, at least not at the beginning, but, because it was restricted to Muslims, it is appropriate to consider it as such. This, however, was not the only type of early Islamic building to be uniquely Muslim. Three other types can be defined architecturally and a fourth one only functionally.",
  " ce  The first type, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, is a unique building. Completed in 691, this masterwork of Islamic architecture is the earliest major Islamic monument. Its octagonal plan, use of a high dome, and building techniques are hardly original, although its decoration is unique. Its purpose, however, is what is most remarkable about the building. Since the middle of the 8th century, the Dome of the Rock has become the focal centre of the most mystical event in the life of the Prophet: his ascension into heaven from the rock around which the building was erected. According to an inscription preserved since the erection of the dome, however, it would seem that the building did not originally commemorate the Prophet\u2019s ascension but rather the Christology of Islam and its relationship to Judaism. It seems preferable, therefore, to interpret the Dome of the Rock as a victory monument of the new faith\u2019s ideological and religious claim on a holy city and on all the religious traditions attached to it.",
  " rib\u0101\u1e6d rib\u0101\u1e6d  The second distinctly Islamic type of religious building is the little-known rib\u0101\u1e6d . As early as in the 8th century, the Muslim empire entrusted the protection of its frontiers, especially the remote ones, to warriors for the faith ( mur\u0101bi\u1e6d\u016bn , \u201cbound ones\u201d) who lived, permanently or temporarily, in special institutions known as rib\u0101\u1e6d s. Evidence for these exist in Central Asia, Anatolia, and North Africa. It is only in Tunisia that rib\u0101\u1e6d s have been preserved. The best one is at Sousse, Tunisia; it consists of a square fortified building with a single fairly elaborate entrance and a central courtyard. It has two stories of private or communal rooms. Except for the prominence taken by an oratory, this building could be classified as a type of Muslim secular architecture. Because no later example of a rib\u0101\u1e6d is known, there is some uncertainty as to whether the institution ever acquired a unique architectural form of its own.",
  " ce  The last type of religious building to develop before the end of the 10th century is the mausoleum . Originally, Islam was strongly opposed to any formal commemoration of the dead. But three independent factors slowly modified an attitude that was eventually maintained only in the most strictly orthodox circles. One factor was the growth of the Shi\u02bfi heterodoxy, which led to an actual cult of the descendants of the Prophet through his son-in-law \u02bfAl\u012b . The second factor was that, as Islam strengthened its hold on conquered lands, a wide variety of local cultic practices and especially the worship of certain sacred places began to affect the Muslims, resulting in a whole movement of Islamization of ancient holy places by associating them with deceased Muslim heroes and holy men or with prophets. The third factor is not, strictly speaking, religious, but it played a major part. As more or less independent local dynasties began to grow, they sought to commemorate themselves through mausoleums. Not many mausoleums have remained from those early centuries, but literary evidence is clear on the fact that the Shi\u02bfi sanctuaries of Karbala and Najaf , both in Iraq, and Qom , Iran, already possessed monumental tombs. At S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be an octagonal mausoleum had been built for three caliphs. The masterpieces of early funerary architecture occur in Central Asia, such as the royal mausoleum of the Samanids (known incorrectly as the mausoleum of Esm\u0101\u02bf\u012bl the Samanid) at Bukhara (before 942), which is a superb example of Islamic brickwork. In some instances a quasi-religious character was attached to the mausoleums, such as the one at Tim (976), which already has the high facade typical of so many later monumental tombs. In all instances the Muslims took over or rediscovered the ancient tradition of the centrally planned building as the characteristic commemorative structure.",
  "The fourth kind of Muslim building is the madrasah, an institution for religious training set up independently of mosques. It is known from texts that such privately endowed schools existed in the northeastern Iranian world as early as the 9th century, but no description exists of how they looked or were planned.",
  "Whereas the functions of the religious buildings of early Islam could not have existed without the new faith, the functions of secular Muslim architecture have a priori no specifically Islamic character. This is all the more so since one can hardly point to a significant new need or habit that would have been brought from Arabia by the conquering Muslims and because so little was destroyed in the conquered areas. It can be assumed, therefore, that all pre-Islamic functions such as living, trading, and manufacturing continued in whatever architectural setting they may have had. Only one exception is certain. With the disappearance of Sasanian kingship, the pre-Islamic Iranian imperial tradition ceased, and elsewhere conquered minor kings and governors left their palaces and castles. A new imperial power was created, located first in Damascus, then briefly in the northern Syrian town of Al-Ru\u1e63\u0101fah, and eventually in Baghdad and S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be in Iraq. New governors and, later, almost independent princes took over provincial capitals, which sometimes were old seats of government and at other times were new Muslim centres. In all instances, however, there is no reason to assume that for an architecture of power or of pleasure early Muslims would have felt the need to modify pre-Islamic traditions. In fact, there is much in early Islamic secular architecture that can be used to illustrate secular arts elsewhere\u2014in Byzantium, for example, or even in the West. If any new political or social entity is to succeed in preserving an identity of its own, however, it must give to its secular needs certain directions and emphases that will eventually establish a unique cultural image. This is what happened in the development of Umayyad and early Abbasid secular architecture.",
  "Three factors contributed to the evolution of a new secular architecture. One was that the accumulation of an immense wealth of ideas, workers, and money in the hands of the Muslim princes settled in Syria and Iraq gave rise to a unique palace architecture. The second factor was the impetus given to urban life and to trade. New cities were founded from Sijilmassa on the edge of the Moroccan Sahara to N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br in northeastern Iran, and 9th-century Arab merchants traded as far away as China. Thus, the second topic, to be treated below, will be the urban design and commercial architecture. The third factor is that, for the first time since Alexander the Great , a world extending from the Mediterranean to India became culturally unified. As a result, decorative motifs, design ideas, structural techniques, and artisans and architects\u2014which until then had belonged to entirely different cultural traditions\u2014were available in the same places. Early Islamic princely architecture has become the best-known and most original aspect of early Islamic secular buildings.",
  "There are basically three kinds of these princely structures. The first type consists of 10 large rural princely complexes found in Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan dating from about 710 to 750: Al-Ru\u1e63\u0101fah, Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr East, Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr West, Jabal Says, Khirbat Minyah, Khirbat al-Mafjar, Mshatt\u0101, Qa\u1e63r \u02bfAmrah, Qa\u1e63r al-Khar\u0101nah, and Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e6c\u016bbah. Apparently, those examples of princely architecture belong to a group of more than 60 ruined or only textually identifiable rural complexes erected by Umayyad princes. In the past a romantic theory had developed about their locations, suggesting that the remoteness of their sites expressed an atavistic hankering on the part of the Umayyad Arab rulers for the desert or at least the semiarid steppe that separates the permanently cultivated areas of Syria and Palestine from their original home in the north Arabian wilderness. This theory has been disproved, for every one of those has turned out to have been a major agricultural or trade centre, some of which were developed even before the Muslim conquest. Private palaces were built, notably at Al-Ru\u1e63\u0101fah, Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr West, Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qa\u1e63r \u02bfAmrah, and Mshatt\u0101. Those must be considered as early medieval equivalents of the villae rusticae so characteristic in the ancient Roman period. Although each of those had a number of idiosyncrasies that were presumably inspired by the needs and desires of its owner, all those structures tend to share a number of features that can best be illustrated by Khirbat al-Mafjar.",
  "That palace, the richest of them all, contained a residential unit consisting of a square building with an elaborate entrance, a porticoed courtyard, and a number of rooms or halls arranged on two floors. Few of those rooms seem to have any identifiable function, although at Khirbat al-Mafjar a private oratory, a large meeting hall, and an anteroom leading to a cool underground pool have been identified. The main throne room was on the second floor above the entrance. Its plan is not known but probably resembled the preserved throne rooms or reception halls at Qa\u1e63r \u02bfAmrah and Mshatt\u0101, which consisted of a three-aisled hall ending in an apse (semicircular or polygonal domed projection) in the manner of a Roman basilica.",
  "Next to an official residence, there usually was a small mosque, generally a miniaturized hypostyle in plan. The most original feature of those establishments was the bath. The bathing area itself is comparatively small, but every bath had its own elaborate entrance and contained a large hall that, at least in the instance of Khirbat al-Mafjar, was heavily decorated and of an unusual shape. It would appear that those halls were for pleasure\u2014places for music, dancing, and probably occasional orgies. In some instances, as at Qa\u1e63r \u02bfAmrah, the same setting may have been used for both pleasure and formal receptions.",
  "Those palaces are important illustrations of the luxurious taste and way of life of the new Middle Eastern aristocrats, who settled in the countryside and transformed some of it into places of pleasure. This aspect of those establishments is peculiar to the Umayyad dynasty in Syria and Palestine. Outside this area and period only one comparable structure has been found\u2014at Ukhay\u1e0dir in Iraq, which dates from the early Abbasid period. A number of princely residences of the Central Asian or North African countryside are still too little known but appear not to have had the same development. The other important lesson to draw from them is that few of their features are original. All of them derive from the architectural vocabulary of pre-Islamic times, and it is in the artistic traditions of the Mediterranean world that most of their sources are found, although the Mshatt\u0101 throne room does have a number of Sasanian elements. For this reason, those palaces should be considered major examples of pre-Islamic secular architecture, for as interesting as they are, these monuments are not part of the Islamic tradition.",
  "A second type of princely architecture\u2014the urban palace\u2014has been preserved only in texts or literary sources, with the exception of the palace at K\u016bfah in Iraq. Datable from the very end of the 7th century, this example of princely architecture seems to have functioned both as a residence and as the d\u0101r al-im\u0101rah , or centre of government. This dual function is reflected in the use of separate building units and in the absence of much architectural decoration, which suggests that it reflected an austere official taste. Although suggestions concerning the plans used are occasionally encountered in literary sources, this information is not sufficient to define those early urban official buildings of the Muslims. Nothing is known, for instance, about the great Umayyad palace in Damascus aside from the fact that it had a green dome.",
  "Also poorly documented is a development in urban aristocratic buildings that seems to have begun with the Abbasids during the last decades of the 8th century. This involved the construction of smaller palaces, probably pavilions in the midst of gardens in or around major cities.",
  "The third type of early Islamic princely architecture is the palace-city. Several of these huge palaces are part of the enormous mass of ruins at S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be, the temporary Abbasid capital from 838 to 883. Jawsaq al-Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b, for instance, is a walled architectural complex nearly one mile to a side that in reality is an entire city. It contains a formal succession of large gates and courts leading to a cross-shaped throne room, a group of smaller living units, basins and fountains, and even a racetrack. Too little is known about the architectural details of those huge walled complexes to lead to more than very uncertain hypotheses. Their existence, however, suggests that they were settings for the very elaborate ceremonies developed by the Abbasid princes, especially when receiving foreign ambassadors. An account, for instance, in Kha\u1e6d\u012bb al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\u2019s (died 1071) Ta\u2019r\u012bkh Baghd\u0101d (\u201cHistory of Baghdad\u201d) of the arrival in Baghdad of a Byzantine envoy in 914 illustrates this point. The meeting with the caliph was preceded by a sort of formal presentation intended to impress the ambassador with the Muslim ruler\u2019s wealth and power. Treasures were laid down; thousands of soldiers and slaves in rich clothes guarded them; lions roared in the gardens; and on gilded artificial trees mechanical devices made silver birds chirp. The ceremony was a fascinating mixture of a traditional attempt to re-create paradise on earth and a rather vulgar exhibition of wealth that required a huge space, as in the S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be palaces. Another important aspect of those palace-cities is that they became part of a myth. The walled enclosure in which thousands lived a life unknown to others and into which simple mortals did not penetrate without bringing their own shroud was transformed into legend. It became the mysterious City of Brass of The Thousand and One Nights , and it is from its luxurious glory that occasionally a caliph such as H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd escaped into the \u201creal\u201d world. Even information on the Abbasid palace-city is inadequate; it was clearly a unique early Islamic creation, and its impact can be detected from Byzantium to Hollywood.",
  "Islamic secular architecture has left considerable information about cities, for systematic urbanization was one of the most characteristic features of early Muslim civilization. It is much too early to draw any sort of conclusion about the actual physical organization of towns, about their subdivisions and their houses, for only at Al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d (Cairo) and S\u012br\u0101f in Iran is the evidence archaeologically clear, and much of it has not yet been properly published. A huge task remains to be done of relating immense amounts of textual material with scraps of archaeological information scattered from Central Asia to Spain, such as the outer walls and impressive gateway preserved at Al-Raqqah in Syria. In general, it can be said that there does not seem to have been any idealized master plan for the internal arrangement of an urban site, in contradistinction to Hellenistic or Roman towns. Even mosques or palaces were often located eccentrically and not in the middle of the town. Extraordinary attention was paid to water distribution and conservation, as demonstrated by the magnificent 9th-century cisterns in Tunisia, the 9th-century Nilometer (a device to measure the Nile\u2019s level) in Cairo, and the elaborate dams, canals, and sluices of Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr in Syria. The construction of commercial buildings on a monumental scale occurred. The most spectacular example is the caravansary of Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr East, with its magnificent gate.",
  "The concern for palaces and cities that characterized early Islamic secular architecture shows itself most remarkably in the construction of Baghdad between 762 and 766\u2013767 by the Abbasid caliph al-Man\u1e63\u016br . It was a walled round city whose circular shape served to demonstrate Baghdad\u2019s symbolic identity as the navel of the universe. A thick ring of residential quarters was separated by four axial commercial streets entered through spectacular gates. In the centre of the city there was a large open space with a palace, a mosque, and a few administrative buildings. By its size and number of inhabitants, Baghdad was unquestionably a city; however, its plan so strongly emphasized the presence of the caliph that it was also a palace.",
  "The early Islamic period, on the whole, did not innovate much in the realm of building materials and technology but utilized what it had inherited from older traditions. Stone and brick continued to be used throughout the Mediterranean, whereas mud brick usually covered with plaster predominated in Iraq and Iran, with a few notable exceptions such as S\u012br\u0101f, where a masonry of roughly cut stones set in mortar was more common. The most important novelty was the rapid development in Iraq of a baked brick architecture in the late 8th and 9th centuries. Iraqi techniques were later used in Syria at Al-Raqqah and Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr East and in Egypt. Iranian brickwork appears at Mshatt\u0101 in Jordan. The mausoleum of the Samanids in Bukhara is the earliest remaining example of the new brick architecture in northeastern Iran. Wood was used consistently but usually has not been very well preserved, except in Palestine and Egypt, where climatic (extreme dryness of Egypt), religious (holiness of Jerusalem sanctuaries), or historic (Egypt was never conquered) factors contributed to the continuous upkeep of wooden objects and architectural elements.",
  "  As supports for roofs and ceilings, early Islamic architecture used walls and single supports. Walls were generally continuous, often buttressed with half towers, and rarely (with exceptions in Central Asia) were they articulated or broken by other architectural features. The most common single support was the base-column-capital combination of Mediterranean architecture. Most columns and capitals either were reused from pre-Islamic buildings or were directly imitated from older models. In the 9th century in Iraq a brick pier was used, a form that spread to Iran and Egypt. Columns and piers were covered with arches . Most often these were semicircular arches; the pointed, or two-centred, arch was known, but it does not seem that its property of reducing the need for heavy supports had been realized. The most extraordinary technical development of arches occurs in the Great Mosque at C\u00f3rdoba , where, in order to increase the height of the building in an area with only short columns, the architects created two rows of superimposed horseshoe arches. Almost immediately they realized that such a succession of superimposed arches constructed of alternating stone and brick could be modified to create a variety of patterns that would alleviate the inherent monotony of a hypostyle building. A certain ambiguity remains, however, as to whether ornamental effect or structural technology was the predominate concern in the creation of those unique arched columns.",
  "The majority of early Islamic ceilings were flat. Gabled wooden roofs , however, were erected in the Muslim world west of the Euphrates and simple barrel vaults to the east. Vaulting, either in brick or in stone, was used, especially in secular architecture. Domes were employed frequently in mosques, consistently in mausoleums, and occasionally in secular buildings. Almost all domes are on squinches (supports carried across corners to act as structural transitions to a dome). Most squinches, as in the Kairouan domes, are classical Greco-Roman niches, which transform the square room into an octagonal opening for the dome. In C\u00f3rdoba\u2019s Great Mosque a complex system of intersecting ribs is encountered, whereas at Bukhara the squinch is broken into halves by a transverse half arch. The most extraordinary use of the squinch occurs in the mausoleum at Tim, where the surface of this structural device is broken into a series of smaller three-dimensional units rearranged into a sort of pyramidal pattern. This rearrangement is the earliest extant example of muqarnas , or stalactite-like decoration that would later be an important element of Islamic architectural ornamentation. The motif is so awkwardly constructed at Tim that it must have derived from some other source, possibly the ornamental device of using curved stucco panels to cover the corners and upper parts of walls found in Iran at N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br.",
  "Early Islamic architecture is most original in its decoration. Mosaics and wall paintings followed the practices of antiquity and were primarily employed in Syria, Palestine, and Spain. Stone sculpture existed, but stucco sculpture, first limited to Iran, spread rapidly throughout the early Islamic world. Not only were stone or brick walls covered with large panels of stucco sculpture, but this technique was used for sculpture in the round in the Umayyad palaces of Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr West and Khirbat al-Mafjar. The latter was a comparatively short-lived technique, although it produced some of the few instances of monumental sculpture anywhere in the early Middle Ages. A variety of techniques borrowed from the industrial arts were used for architectural ornamentation. The mihrab wall of Kairouan\u2019s Great Mosque, for example, was covered with ceramics, whereas fragments of decorative woodwork have been preserved in Jerusalem and Egypt.",
  "The themes and motifs of early Islamic decoration can be divided into three major groups. The first kind of ornamentation simply emphasizes the shape or contour of an architectural unit. The themes used were vegetal bands for vertical or horizontal elements, marble imitations for the lower parts of long walls, chevrons or other types of borders on floors and domes, and even whole trees on the spandrels or soffits (undersides) of arches as in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus or the Dome of the Rock; all these motifs tend to be quite traditional, being taken from the rich decorative vocabularies of pre-Islamic Iran or of the ancient Mediterranean world.",
  "The second group consists of decorative motifs for which a concrete iconographic meaning can be given. In the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, as well as possibly the mosques of C\u00f3rdoba and of Medina, there were probably iconographic programs. It has been shown, for example, that the huge architectural and vegetal decorative motifs at Damascus were meant to symbolize a sort of idealized paradise on earth, whereas the crowns of the Jerusalem sanctuary are thought to have been symbols of empires conquered by Islam. But it is equally certain that this use of visual forms in mosques for ideological and symbolic purposes was not easily accepted, and most later mosques are devoid of iconographically significant themes. The only exceptions fully visible are the Qur\u02be\u0101nic inscriptions in the mosque of Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn at Cairo, which were used both as a reminder of the faith and as an ornamental device to emphasize the structural lines of the building. Thus, the early Islamic mosque eventually became austere in its use of symbolic ornamentation, with the exception of the mihrab, which was considered as a symbol of the unity of all believers.",
  "Like religious architecture, secular buildings seem to have been less richly decorated at the end of the early Islamic period than at the beginning. The paintings, sculptures, and mosaics of Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr West, Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qa\u1e63r \u02bfAmrah, and S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be primarily illustrated the life of the prince. There were official iconographic compositions, such as the monarch enthroned, or ones of pleasure and luxury, such as hunting scenes or depictions of the prince surrounded by dancers, musicians, acrobats, and unclad women. Few of these so-called princely themes were iconographic inventions of the Muslims. They usually can be traced back either to the classical world of ancient Greece and Rome or to pre-Islamic Iran and Central Asia.",
  "The third type of architectural decoration consists of large panels, most often in stucco, for which no meaning or interpretation is yet known. Those panels might be called ornamental in the sense that their only apparent purpose was to beautify the buildings in which they were installed, and their relationship to the architecture is arbitrary. The Mshatt\u0101 facade\u2019s decoration of a huge band of triangles is, for instance, quite independent of the building\u2019s architectural parts. Next to Mshatt\u0101, the most important series of examples of the third type of ornamentation come from S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be, although striking examples are also to be found at Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr East and West, Al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d, S\u012br\u0101f, and N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br. Two decorative motifs were predominately used on those panels: a great variety of vegetal motifs and geometric forms. At S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be those panels eventually became so abstract that individual parts could no longer be distinguished, and the decorative design had to be viewed in terms of the relationships between line and shape, light and shade, horizontal and vertical axes, and so forth. Copied consistently from Morocco to Central Asia, the aesthetic principles of this latter type of a complex overall design influenced the development of the principle of arabesque ornamentation.",
  "Islamic architectural ornamentation does not lend itself easily to chronological stylistic definition. In other words, it does not seem to share consistently a cluster of formal characteristics. The reason is that in the earliest Islamic buildings the decorative motifs were borrowed from an extraordinary variety of stylistic sources: classical themes illusionistically rendered (e.g., the mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus), hieratic Byzantine themes (e.g., the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus and Qa\u1e63r \u02bfAmrah), Sasanian motifs, Central Asian motifs (especially the sculpture from Umayyad palaces), and the many regional styles of ornamentation that had developed in all parts of the pre-Islamic world. It is the wealth of themes and motifs, therefore, that constitutes the Umayyad style of architectural decoration. The Abbasids, on the other hand, began to be more selective in their choice of ornamentation.",
  "Very little is known about early Islamic gold and silver objects, although their existence is mentioned in many texts as well as suggested by the wealth of the Muslim princes. Except for a large number of silver plates and ewers belonging to the Sasanian tradition, nothing has remained. Those silver objects were probably made for Umayyad and Abbasid princes, although there is much controversy among scholars regarding their authenticity and date of manufacture.",
  "For entirely different reasons it is impossible to present any significant generalities about the art of textiles in the early Islamic period. Problems of authenticity are few. Dating from the 10th century are a large number of Buyid silks, a group of funerary textiles with plant and animal motifs as well as poetic texts. Very little order has yet been made of an enormous mass of often well-dated textile fragments, and, therefore, except for the Buyid silks, it is still impossible to identify any one of the textile types mentioned in early medieval literary sources. Furthermore, because it can be assumed that pre-Islamic textile factories were taken over by the Muslims and because it is otherwise known that textiles were easily transported from one area of the Muslim world to the other or even beyond it, it is still very difficult to define Islamic styles as opposed to Byzantine or to Coptic ones. The obvious exception lies in those fragments that are provided with inscriptions, and the main point to make is, therefore, that one of the characteristic features of early Islamic textiles is their use of writing for identifying and decorative purposes. But, while true, this point in no way makes it possible to deny an Islamic origin to fragments that are not provided with inscriptions, and one must thus await further investigations of detail before being able to define early Islamic textiles.",
  "  The most important medium of early Islamic decorative arts is pottery. Initially Muslims continued to sponsor whatever varieties of ceramics had existed before their arrival. Probably in the last quarter of the 8th century, new and more elaborate types of glazed pottery were produced. This new development did not replace the older and simpler types of pottery but added a new dimension to the art of Islamic ceramics. Because of the still incompletely published studies on the unfinished excavations carried out at N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br, S\u012br\u0101f, Qa\u1e63r al-\u1e24ayr East, and Al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d, the scholarship on those ceramics is likely to be very much modified. Therefore, this section will treat only the most general characteristics of Islamic ceramics, avoiding in particular the complex archaeological problems posed by the growth and spread of individual techniques.",
  "The area of initial technical innovation seems to have been Iraq. Trade with Central Asia brought Chinese ceramics to Mesopotamia, and Islamic ceramicists sought to imitate them. It is probably in Iraq, therefore, that the technique of lustre glazing was first developed in the Muslim world. This gave the surface of a clay object a metallic, shiny appearance. Egypt also played a leading part in the creation of the new ceramics. Because the earliest datable lustre object (a glass goblet with the name of the governor who ruled in 773, now in the Cairo Museum of Islamic Ceramics) was Egyptian, some scholars feel that it was in Egypt and not Iraq that lustre was first used. Early pottery was also produced in northeastern Iran, where excavations at Afr\u0101siy\u0101b ( Samarkand ) and N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br have brought to light a new art of painted underglaze pottery. Its novelty was not so much in the technique of painting designs on the slip and covering them with a transparent glaze as in the variety of subjects employed.",
  "While new ceramic techniques may have been sought to imitate other mediums (mostly metal) or other styles of pottery (mostly Chinese), the decorative devices rapidly became purely and unmistakably Islamic in style. A wide variety of motifs were combined: vegetal arabesques or single flowers and trees; inscriptions, usually legible and consisting of proverbs or of good wishes; animals that were usually birds drawn from the vast folkloric past of the Middle East; occasionally human figures drawn in a strikingly abstract fashion; geometric designs; all-over abstract patterns; single motifs on empty fields; and simple splashes of colour, with or without underglaze sgraffito designs (i.e., designs incised or sketched on the body or the slip of the object). All these motifs were used on both the high-quality ceramics of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br and Samarkand as well as on Islamic folk pottery.",
  "  Although ceramics has appeared to be the most characteristic medium of expression in the decorative arts during the early Islamic period, it has only been because of the greater number of preserved objects. Glass was as important, but examples have been less well preserved. A tradition of ivory carving developed in Spain, and the objects dating from the last third of the 10th century onward attest to the high quality of this uniquely Iberian art. Many of those carved ivories certainly were made for princes; therefore, it is not surprising that their decorative themes were drawn from the whole vocabulary of princely art known through Umayyad painting and sculpture of the early 8th century. Those ivory carvings are also important in that they exemplify the fact that an art of sculpture in the round never totally disappeared in the Muslim world\u2014at least in small objects.",
  "There are three general points that seem to characterize the art of the early Islamic period. It can first be said that it was an art that sought self-consciously, like the culture sponsoring it, to create artistic forms that would be identifiable as being different from those produced in preceding or contemporary non-Islamic artistic traditions. At times, as in the use of the Greco-Roman technique of mosaics or in the adoption of Persian and Roman architectural building technology, early Islamic art simply took over whatever traditions were available. At other times, as in the development of the mosque as a building type, it recomposed into new shapes the forms that had existed before. On the other hand, in ceramics or the use of calligraphic ornamentation, the early Islamic artist invented new techniques and a new decorative vocabulary. Whatever the nature of the phenomenon, it was almost always an attempt to identify itself visually as unique and different. Because there was initially no concept about what should constitute an Islamic tradition in the visual arts, the early art of the Muslims often looks like only a continuation of earlier artistic styles, forms, subjects, and techniques. Many mosaics, silver plates, or textiles, therefore, were not considered to be Islamic until recently. In order to be understood, then, as examples of the art of a new culture, those early buildings and objects have to be seen in the complete context in which they were created. When so seen, they appear as conscious choices by the new Islamic culture from its immense artistic inheritance.",
  "A second point of definition concerns the question of whether there is an early Islamic style or perhaps even several styles in some sort of succession. The fascinating fact is that there is a clear succession only in those artistic features that are Islamic inventions\u2014nonfigurative ornament and ceramics. For it is only in development of those features that one can assume to find the conscious search for form that can create a period style. Elsewhere, especially in palace art, the Muslim world sought to relate itself to an earlier and more universal tradition of princely art; its monuments, therefore, are less Islamic than typological. In the new art of the Muslim bourgeoisie, however, uniquely Islamic artistic phenomena began to evolve.",
  "Finally, the geographical peculiarities of early Islamic art must be reiterated. Its centres were Syria, Iraq, Egypt, northwestern Iran, and Spain. Of these, Iraq was probably the most originally creative, and it is from Iraq that a peculiarly Islamic visual koine (a commonly accepted and understood system of forms) was derived and spread throughout the Islamic world. This development, of course, is logical, because the capital of the early empire and some of the first purely Muslim cities were in Iraq. In western Iran, in Afghanistan, in northern Mesopotamia, and in Morocco, the more atypical and local artistic traditions were more or less affected by the centralized imperial system of Iraq. This tension between a general pan-Islamic vocabulary and a variable number of local vocabularies was to remain a constant throughout the history of Islamic art and is certainly one of the reasons for the difficulty, if not impossibility, one faces in trying to define an Islamic style.",
  "The middle period in the development of Islamic art extends roughly from the year 1000 to 1500, when a strong central power with occasional regional political independence was replaced by a bewildering mosaic of overlapping dynasties. Ethnically, this was the time of major Turkish and Mongol invasions that brought into the Muslim world new peoples and institutions. At the same time, Imazighen ( Berbers ), Kurds , and Iranians , who had been within the empire from the beginning of Islam, began to play far more effective historical and cultural roles, short-lived for the Kurds but uniquely important for the Iranians. Besides political and ethnic confusion, there was also religious and cultural confusion during the middle period. The 10th century, for example, witnessed the transformation of the Shi\u02bfi heterodoxy into a major political and possibly cultural phenomenon, while the extraordinary development taken by the personal and social mysticism known as Sufism modified enormously the nature of Muslim piety. Culturally, the most significant development was perhaps that of Persian literature as a highly original new verbal expression existing alongside the older Arabic literary tradition . Finally, the middle period was an era of geopolitical expansion in all areas except Spain, which was completely lost to the Muslims in 1492 with the conquest of the kingdom of Granada by Ferdinand II and Isabella . Anatolia and the Balkans, the Crimean Peninsula , much of Central Asia and northern India, and parts of eastern Africa all became new Islamic provinces. In some cases this expansion was the result of conquests, but in others it had been achieved through missionary work.",
  "The immense variety of impulses that affected the Muslim world during those five centuries was one of the causes of the bewildering artistic explosion that also characterizes the middle period. Although much work has been done on individual monuments, scholarship is still in its infancy. It is particularly difficult, therefore, to decide on the appropriate means of organizing this information: by geographical or cultural areas (e.g., Iran, Egypt, Morocco), by individual dynasties (e.g., Seljuqs, Timurids), by periods (e.g., 13th century before the Mongol invasions), or even by social categories (e.g., the art of princes, the art of cities). Thus, the five following divisions of Fatimid , Seljuq , Western Islamic, Mamluk , and Mongol Iran ( Il-Khanid and Timurid ) art are partly arbitrary and to a large extent tentative. Their respective importance also varies, for what is known as Seljuq art certainly overwhelms almost all others in its importance.",
  "  The Fatimids were technically an Arab dynasty professing with missionary zeal the beliefs of the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b sect of the Shi\u02bfi branch of Islam. The dynasty was established in Tunisia and Sicily in 909. In 969 the Fatimids moved to Egypt and founded the city of Cairo . They soon controlled Syria and Palestine. In the latter part of the 11th century, however, the Fatimid empire began to disintegrate internally and externally; the final demise occurred in 1171. But it is not known which of the obvious components of the Fatimid world was more significant in influencing the development of the visual arts: its heterodoxy, its Egyptian location, its missionary relationship with almost all provinces of Islam, or the fact that during its heyday in the 11th century it was the only wealthy Islamic centre and could thus easily gather artisans and art objects from all over the world.",
  "The great Fatimid mosques of Cairo \u2014Al-Azhar (started in 970) and Al-\u1e24\u0101kim (c. 1002\u201303)\u2014were designed in the traditional hypostyle plan with axial cupolas. It is only in such architectural details as the elaborately composed facade of Al-\u1e24\u0101kim, with its corner towers and vaulted portal, that innovations appear, for most earlier mosques did not have large formal gates, nor was much attention previously given to the composition of the exterior facade. Fatimid architectural traditionalism was certainly a conscious attempt to perpetuate the existing aesthetic system.",
  "Although much less is known about it, the Great Palace of the Fatimids belonged to the tradition of the enormous palace-cities typical of the Abbasids. Mediterranean rather than Iranian influences, however, played a greater part in the determination of its uses and functions. The whole city of Cairo (Arabic: Al-Q\u0101hirah, \u201cThe Victorious\u201d), on the other hand, has many symbolic and visual aspects that suggest a willful relationship to Baghdad .",
  "The originality of Fatimid architecture does not lie in works sponsored by the caliphs themselves, even though Cairo\u2019s well-preserved gates and walls of the second half of the 11th century are among the best examples of early medieval military architecture. It is rather the patronage of lower officials and of the bourgeoisie, if not even of the humbler classes, that was responsible for the most interesting Fatimid buildings. The mosques of Al-Aqmar (1125) and of Al-\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 (c. 1160) are among the first examples of monumental small mosques constructed to serve local needs. Even though their internal arrangement is quite traditional, their plans were adapted to the space available in the urban centre. These mosques were elaborately decorated on the exterior, exhibiting a conspicuousness absent from large hypostyle mosques.",
  "A second innovation in Fatimid architecture was the tremendous development of mausoleums . This may be explained partially by Shi\u02bfism\u2019s emphasis on the succession of holy men, but the development of these buildings in terms of both quality and quantity indicates that other influential social and religious issues were also involved. Most of the mausoleums were simple square buildings surmounted by a dome. Many of these have survived in Cairo and Asw\u0101n . Only a few, such as the mashhad at Asw\u0101n, are somewhat more elaborate, with side rooms. The most original of these commemorative buildings is the Juy\u016bsh\u012b Mosque (1085) overlooking the city of Cairo. Properly speaking, it is not a mausoleum but a monument celebrating the reestablishment of Fatimid order after a series of popular revolts.",
  "The Fatimids introduced, or developed, only two major constructional techniques: the systematization of the four-centred keel arch and the squinch. The latter innovation is of greater consequence because the squinch became the most common means of passing from a square to a dome, although pendentives were known as well. A peculiarly Egyptian development was the muqarnas squinch, which consisted of four units: a niche bracketed by two niche segments, superimposed with an additional niche. The complex profile of the muqarnas became an architectural element in itself used for windows, while the device of using niches and niche segments remained typical of Egyptian decorative design for centuries. It still is impossible to say whether the muqarnas was invented in Egypt or inspired by other architectural traditions (most likely Iranian). Fatimid domes were smooth or ribbed and developed a characteristic \u201ckeel\u201d profile.",
  "In the use of materials (brick, stone, wood) and structural concepts, Fatimid architecture continued earlier traditions. Occasionally, local styles were incorporated, among them features of Tunisian architecture in the 10th century or of upper Mesopotamian in the late 11th century.",
  "  Stone sculpture, stuccowork , and carved wood were utilized for architectural decorations. The Fatimids also employed mosaicists, who mostly worked in places like Jerusalem, where they imitated or repaired earlier mosaic murals. Many fragments of Fatimid wall paintings have survived in Egypt. Most of them, however, are too small to allow for making any iconographic or stylistic conclusions, with the exception of the mid-12th-century ceiling of the Palatine Chapel at Palermo. Built by the Norman kings of Sicily, the palace chapel was almost certainly decorated by Fatimid artists, or at least the artists adhered to Fatimid models. The hundreds of facets in the muqarnas ceiling were painted, notably with many purely ornamental vegetal and zoomorphic designs but also with scenes of daily life and many subjects that have not yet been explained. Stylistically influenced by Iraqi Abbasid art, these paintings are innovative in their more spatially aware representation of personages and of animals. Very similar tendencies appear also in the stucco and wood sculptures of Fatimid decoration. The stunning abstraction of the architectural decoration at S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be tends to give way to more naturalistically conceived vegetal and animal designs; occasionally, whole narrative scenes appear carved on wood. Another decorative trend is especially used on 12th-century mihrabs: explicitly complicated geometric patterns, usually based on stars, which in turn generate octagons, hexagons, triangles, and rectangles. Geometry becomes a sort of network containing small vegetal units, often as inlaid pieces. Long inscriptions written in very elaborate calligraphies also became a typical form of architectural decoration on most of the major Fatimid buildings.",
  "    A clear separation must be made between the decorative arts sought by Fatimid princes and the arts produced within their empire. Little has been preserved of the former, notably a small number of superb ewers in rock crystal. A text has survived, however, that describes the imperial treasures looted in the middle of the 11th century by dissatisfied mercenary troops. It lists gold, silver, enamel, and porcelain objects that have all been lost, as well as textiles (perhaps the cape of the Norman king Roger II is an example of the kind of textiles found in this treasure). The inventory also records that the Fatimids had in their possession many works of Byzantine, Chinese, and even Greco-Roman provenance. Altogether, then, it seems that the imperial art of the Fatimids was part of a sort of international royal taste that downplayed cultural or political differences.",
  "  Ceramics, on the other hand, were primarily produced by local urban schools and were not an imperial art. The most-celebrated type of Fatimid wares were lustre-painted ceramics from Egypt itself. A large number of artisans\u2019 names have been preserved, thereby indicating the growing prestige of these craftsmen and the aesthetic importance of their pottery. Most of the surviving lustre ceramics are plates on which the decoration of the main surface has been emphasized. The decorative themes used were quite varied and included all the traditional Islamic ones\u2014e.g., calligraphy, vegetal and animal motifs, arabesques. The most-distinguishing feature of these Fatimid ceramics, however, is the representation of the human figure. Some of these ceramics have been decorated with simplified copies of illustrations of the princely themes, but others have depictions of scenes of Egyptian daily life. The style in which these themes have been represented is simultaneously the hieratic, ornamental manner traditional to Islamic painting combined with what can almost be called spatial illusionism. Wheel-cut rock crystal, glass, and bronze objects, especially animal-shaped aquamaniles (a type of water vessel) and ewers, are also attributed to the Fatimids.",
  "Manifestations of nonprincely Fatimid art also included the art of book illustration. The few remaining fragments illustrate that probably after the middle of the 11th century there developed an art of representation other than the style used to illustrate princely themes. This was a more illusionistic style that still accompanied the traditional ornamental one in the same manner as in the paintings on ceramics.",
  "In summary it would appear that Fatimid art was a curiously transitional one. Although much influenced by earlier Islamic and non-Islamic Mediterranean styles, the Fatimids devised new structural systems and developed a new manner of painting representational subjects, which became characteristic of all Muslim art during the 12th century. Neither documentary nor theoretical research in Islamic art, however, has developed sufficiently to clearly establish whether the Fatimids were indeed innovators or whether their art was a local phenomenon that is only accidentally relatable to what followed.",
  "During the last decades of the 10th century, at the Central Asian frontiers of Islam, a migratory movement of Turkic peoples began that was to affect the whole Muslim world up to and including Egypt. The dominant political force among those Turks was the dynasty of the Seljuqs, but it was not the only one; nor can it be demonstrated, as far as the arts are concerned, that it was the major source of patronage in the period to be discussed anywhere but in Anatolia in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Seljuq empire, therefore, consisted of a succession of dynasties, and all but one (the Ayy\u016bbids of Syria, Egypt, and northern Mesopotamia) were Turkic.",
  "A complex feudal system was established and centred on urban areas. Cities were established or expanded, particularly in western Iran, Anatolia, and Syria. Militant Muslims, the Seljuqs also sought to revive Muslim orthodoxy. Although politically unruly and complicated in their relationships to one another, the successive and partly overlapping dynasties of the Ghaznavids , Gh\u016brids , Great Seljuqs (Turkmens of the Iranian plateau), Qarakh\u0101nids , Zangids , Ayy\u016bbids, Seljuqs of R\u016bm, and Khw\u0101rezm-Shahs (considering only the major ones) seem to have created a comparatively unified culture from India to Egypt. The art of the Seljuq period, however, is difficult to discuss coherently, both because of the wealth of examples and because of the lack of synchronization between various technical and regional developments. This complex world fell apart under the impact of the Mongol invasions that, from 1220 until 1260, swept through the Muslim lands of the Middle East.",
  "The functions of monumental architecture in the Seljuq period were considerably modified. Large congregational mosques were still built. The earliest Seljuq examples occur in the two major new provinces of Islam\u2014Anatolia and northwestern India\u2014as well as in the established Muslim region of western Iran. In some areas, such as the E\u1e63fah\u0101n region, congregational mosques were rebuilt, while in other parts of the Islamic world, such as Syria or Egypt, where there was no need for new large mosques, older ones were repaired and small ones were built. The latter were partly restricted to certain quarters or groups or were commissioned by various guilds, particularly in Damascus.",
  "A curious side aspect of the program of building, rebuilding, or decorating mosques was the extraordinary development of minarets . Particularly in Iran, dozens of minarets are preserved from the 12th and 13th centuries, while the mosques to which they had been attached have disappeared. It is as though the visual function of the minaret was more important than the religious institution to which it was attached.",
  "  Small or large, mausoleums increased in numbers and became at this time the ubiquitous monument they appear to be. Most of the mausoleums, such as the tomb tower of Ab\u016b Yaz\u012bd al-Bis\u1e6d\u0101m\u012b (died 874) at Bas\u1e6d\u0101m , were dedicated to holy men\u2014both contemporary Muslim saints and all sorts of holy men dead for centuries (even pre-Islamic holy men, especially biblical prophets, acquired a monument). The most impressive mausoleums, however, like the one of Sanjar at Merv , were built for royalty. Pilgrimages were organized and in many places hardly mentioned until then as holy places (e.g., Mashhad, Bas\u1e6d\u0101m, Mosul , Aleppo ); a whole monastic establishment serving as a centre for the distribution of alms was erected with hostels and kitchens for the pilgrims .",
  "Although enormously expanded, mosques, minarets, and mausoleums were not new types of Islamic architecture. The madrasah (school), however, was a new building type. There is much controversy as to why and how it really developed. Although early examples have been discovered in Iran, such as the 11th-century madrasah of Khargird, and at Samarkand (now in Uzbekistan), it is from Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt that most of the information about the madrasah has been derived. In the latter regions it was usually a privately endowed establishment reserved for one or two of the schools of jurisprudence of orthodox Islam. It had to have rooms for teaching and living quarters for the students and professors. Often the tomb of the founder was attached to the madrasah. Later madrasahs were built for two or three schools of jurisprudence, and the Mustan\u1e63iriyyah in Baghdad was erected in 1233 to be a sort of ecumenical madrasah for the whole of Sunni Islam.",
  "In the Seljuq period there occurred a revival of the hostel-like rib\u0101\u1e6d inside cities. Kh\u0101nq\u0101h s (monastic complexes), monasteries, and various establishments of learning other than formal madrasahs were also built.",
  "An impressive development of secular architecture occurred under the Seljuqs. The most characteristic building of the time was the citadel, or urban fortress, through which the new princes controlled the usually alien city they held in fief. The largest citadels, like those of Cairo and Aleppo, were whole cities with palaces, mosques, sanctuaries, and baths. Others, like the citadel of Damascus, were simpler constructions. Occasionally, as in the Euphrates valley, single castles were built, possibly in imitation of those constructed by the Christian Crusaders. Walls surrounded most cities, and all of them were built or rebuilt during the Seljuq period.",
  "Little is known about Seljuq palaces or private residences in general. A few fragments in Konya or in Mosul are insufficient to give a coherent idea about urban palaces, and it is only in Anatolia and in Central Asia that an adequate idea of other types can be obtained. Anatolian palaces are on the whole rather small villa-like establishments, but, in Afghanistan and Central Asia, excavations at Tirmidh, Lashkar\u012b B\u0101z\u0101r, and Ghazn\u012b have brought to light a whole group of large royal palaces erected in the 11th and early 12th centuries.",
  "  Commercial architecture became very important. Individual princes and cities probably were trying to attract business by erecting elaborate caravansaries on the main trade routes, such as Rib\u0101\u1e6d-i Malik, built between Samarkand and Bukhara in Uzbekistan. The most spectacular caravansaries were built in the 13th century in Anatolia. Equally impressive, however, although less numerous, are the caravansaries erected in eastern Iran and northern Iraq. Bridges also were rebuilt and decorated like the one at Cizre in Turkey.",
  "The forms of architecture developed by the Seljuqs were remarkably numerous and varied considerably from region to region. Because the Iranian innovations dating from the 11th century and first half of the 12th century are the earliest and, therefore, probably influenced all other areas of the Seljuq empire, they will be discussed first.",
  "Even though it is not entirely typical, the justly celebrated Great Mosque of E\u1e63fah\u0101n was one of the most influential of all early Seljuq religious structures. Probably completed about 1130 after a long and complicated history of rebuildings, it consisted of a large courtyard on which opened four large vaulted halls known as eyv\u0101n s; the eyv\u0101n s created the compositional axes of each side of the court. On the side of the qiblah (which indicates the direction of the sacred shrine of the Ka\u02bfbah, faced by the faithful during prayers), the hall of the main eyv\u0101n was followed by a huge cupola. The area between eyv\u0101n s was subdivided into a large number of square bays covered by domes. The E\u1e63fah\u0101n mosque also had a unique feature: on the north side a single domed hall positioned on the main axis of the building was in all probability a formal hall for princes to change their clothes before entering into the sanctuary of the mosque.",
  " eyv\u0101n  The two features of the Great Mosque at E\u1e63fah\u0101n that became characteristic of Seljuq mosques were the eyv\u0101n and the dome. The eyv\u0101n was an architectural element known already in Sasanian architecture that had been used in residential buildings from Egypt to Central Asia before the 11th century. In fact, the use of the eyv\u0101n was not restricted to just mosques; it also appears in palaces (Lashkar\u012b B\u0101z\u0101r), caravansaries (Reb\u0101\u1e6d-e Sharaf), and madrasahs. The eyv\u0101n was, in other words, a unit of architectural composition that had no specific use and, therefore, no meaning. In the mosques of the 12th century, four eyv\u0101n s were used, at least in the clearly definable architectural school of western Iran (e.g., Ardest\u0101n, Zav\u0101reh). This kind of composition had two principal effects. One was that the eyv\u0101n s centralized the visual effect of the mosque by making the courtyard the centre of the building. The other effect of this composition was that it broke up into four areas what had for centuries been a characteristic of the mosque: its single, unified space. The reasons for those developments are still speculative.",
  "Whether large or small, cupolas or domes were used in mosques, caravansaries, and palaces. They were the main architectural features of almost all mausoleums, where they were set over circular or polygonal rooms.",
  "  Two characteristic Iranian architectural forms are not present in the Great Mosque of  E\u1e63fah\u0101n but occur elsewhere in the city. One is the tower. Those narrow and tall (up to about 150 feet [50 metres]) were minarets, of which several dozen have been preserved all over Iran and Central Asia (such as the one at J\u0101m). Shorter and squatter towers were mausoleums. Those were particularly typical of northern Iran. The other characteristic architectural type exists only in E\u1e63fah\u0101n in a much-damaged state. It is the p\u012bsh\u1e6d\u0101q , a formal gateway that served to emphasize a building\u2019s presence and importance.",
  "Domes and eyv\u0101n s indicate that the central concern of Iranian construction during the Seljuq period was vaulting in baked brick, which became the main vehicle for any monumental construction (mud brick was used for secondary parts of a building, frequently for certain secular structures). A large and forcefully composed octagonal base developed the muqarnas squinch from a purely ornamental feature into one wherein both structural and decorative functions combined. In some later buildings, such as the mausoleum of Sanjar at Merv, a system of ribs was used to vault an octagonal zone. Seljuq architects sought to make their domes visible from afar and for that reason invented the double dome. Its outer shell was raised on a high drum, while the interior kept the traditional sequence: square base, zone of transition, and dome. Using this structural device, therefore, exterior height was achieved without making the exterior dome too heavy and without complicating the task of decorating the interior, always a problem in countries like Iran with limited supplies of wood for scaffolding. Domes along the eyv\u0101n s were another factor that contributed to the growing separation between the exterior and the interior view of a building. The construction of tall circular or polygonal minarets and high facades also indicate an emphasis on visibility from a distance.",
  "Architectural decoration was intimately tied to structure. Two mediums predominated. One was stucco, which continued to be used to cover large wall surfaces. The other was brick. Originating in the 10th-century architecture of northeastern Iran, brick came to be employed as a medium of construction as well as a medium of decoration. The complex decorative designs worked out in brick often had a rigidly geometric effect. Especially cut shapes of terra-cotta and brick, frequently produced in unusual sizes, served to soften those geometric patterns by modifying their tactile impact and by introducing additional curved or beveled lines to the straight lines of geometry.",
  "Paintings were used for architectural decoration, especially in palaces. From the second half of the 12th century, coloured tiles began to be utilized to emphasize the contour of a decorative area in a structural unit; tiles were not used to cover whole walls, however. There are also examples of architectural sculpture of animals and people.",
  "Most of the decorative designs tended to be subordinated to geometry, and even calligraphic or vegetal patterns were affected by a seemingly mathematically controlled aesthetic. It has been suggested that those complex geometric designs were a result of an almost mystical passion for number theories that were popularized in 11th-century Iran by such persons as the scholar and scientist al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b or the poet-mathematician Omar Khayyam . But even if the impulses for geometric design were originally created at the highest intellectual level, the designs themselves rapidly became automatic patterns. Their quality was generally high, but a tendency toward facility can be observed in such buildings as Reb\u0101\u1e6d-e Sharaf.",
  "In Iraq, northern Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt (after 1171), the architectural monuments do not, on the whole, appear as overwhelmingly impressive as those of Iran, largely because the taste of Umayyad and Abbasid times continued to dominate mosque architecture. It is in the construction of new building types, particularly the madrasah, that the most originality is apparent. The Syrian madrasahs in Damascus, like Al-\u02bf\u0100diliyyah, Al-\u1e92\u0101hiriyyah, or the works of Nureddin , tended also to follow a comparatively standardized plan: an elaborate facade led into a domed hallway and then into a court with at least one eyv\u0101n . Most of those madrasahs were small and were fitted into a preexisting urban pattern. The use of eyv\u0101n s and the construction of the many minarets found in Mosul or on the Euphrates certainly attest to the influence of Iranian Seljuq design.",
  "The main achievement of Ayy\u016bbid, Zangid, or Seljuq architecture in the Fertile Crescent was the translating into stone of new structural systems first developed in brick. The most impressive instance of this lies in the technically complex muqarnas domes and half domes or in the muqarnas pendentives of Syrian buildings. Elaborate mihrabs were also made of multicoloured stones that were carefully cut to create impressive patterns. The architecture of the Fertile Crescent, therefore, was still dominated by the sheer force of stone as a material for both construction and decoration, and, therefore, the architecture was more Mediterranean in effect than were the buildings of Iran.",
  "This Mediterranean tendency was also evident in the 13th-century architecture of Seljuq Anatolia. This new province of Islam was rapidly populated with new immigrants and consequently gathered themes and motifs from throughout the Muslim world, as well as from the several native Anatolian traditions of Byzantine, Armenian, and Georgian architecture. The resulting assimilation of styles produced an overwhelmingly original architecture, for each building in Konya , Kayseri , Sivas , Divri\u011fi , and Erzurum and on the roads between them is a unique monument.",
  "Functionally, the buildings in Anatolia do not differ from those in other parts of the Muslim world. All the structural forms found in Syria and Iran can be found in Anatolia as well, although they have often been adapted to local materials. Three uniquely Anatolian architectural features, however, can be distinguished. One was limited to Konya at this time but would have an important widespread development later on. As it appears in the Ince or Karatay medrese s (madrasahs), it consists of the transformation of the central courtyard into a domed space while maintaining the eyv\u0101n . Thus, the centralized aspect of the eyv\u0101n plan becomes architecturally explicit. The second feature is the creation of a facade that usually consisted of a high central portal\u2014often framed by two minarets\u2014with an elaborately sculpted decorative composition that extended to two corner towers. The third distinguishing feature of Anatolian Seljuq architecture is the complexity of the types of funerary monuments that were constructed.",
  "From the point of view of construction, most of Anatolian architecture is of stone. In Konya and a number of eastern Anatolian instances, brick was used. Barrel vaults, groin vaults, muqarnas vaults, squinch domes, pendentive domes, and the new pendentive known as Turkish triangle (a transformation of the curved space of the traditional pendentive into a fanlike set of long and narrow triangles built at an angle from each other) were all used by Anatolian builders, thereby initiating the great development of vault construction in Ottoman architecture.",
  "  Architectural decoration consisted primarily in the stone sculpture found on the facades of religious and secular buildings. Although influenced by Iran and Syria in many details, most Anatolian themes were original, although some exhibit Armenian and possibly Western influences. The exuberance of Anatolian architectural decoration can perhaps be best demonstrated in the facades of Sivas\u2019s G\u00f6k Medrese and of Konya\u2019s Ince Minare. In addition to the traditional geometric, epigraphic, and vegetal motifs, a decorative sculpture in the round or in high relief was created that included many representations of human figures and especially animals. Whether this sculpture is essentially a reflection of the decorative wealth of pre-Islamic monuments in Anatolia or whether it is a vestige of a pagan Turkish art that originated in Central Asia is still an unsolved historical problem.",
  "There are few examples of wall painting from Anatolia. Especially in Konya, however, a major art of painted-tile decoration did evolve, possibly developed by Iranian artists who fled from the Mongol onslaught.",
  "In summing up the architectural development of the Seljuq period, three points seem to be particularly significant. One is the expansion of building typology and the erection of new monumental architectural forms, thus illustrating an expansion of patronage and a growing complexity of taste. The second point is that, regardless of the quality and interest of monuments in the Fertile Crescent , Egypt, and Anatolia, the most inventive and exciting architecture in the 11th and 12th centuries was that of Iran. But, far more than in the preceding period, regional needs and regional characteristics seem to predominate over synchronic and pan-Islamic ones. Finally, there was a striking growth of architectural decoration both in sophistication of design and in variation of technique.",
  "Although probably not as varied as architecture, the other arts of the Seljuq period also underwent tremendous changes. They demonstrate an extraordinary artistic energy, a widening of the social patronage of the arts, and a hitherto unknown variety of topics and modes of expression. It was as though the Seljuq period was gathering a sort of aesthetic momentum, but that effort seems to have been curtailed by the Mongol invasion. Chronologically, almost all surviving documentation and examples of those arts date from the latter part of the period, after 1150. It is unclear whether this apparent date is merely an accidental result of what has been preserved and is known through later scholarship or whether it corresponds to some precise event or series of events.",
  "  Glass and textiles continued to be major mediums during the Seljuq period. Ceramics underwent many changes, especially in Iran, where lustre painting became widespread and where new techniques were developed for colouring pottery. Furthermore, the growth of tile decoration created a new dimension for the art of ceramics.",
  "Inlaid metalwork became an important technique. First produced at Her\u0101t in Iran (now in Afghanistan) in the middle of the 12th century, this type of decoration spread westward, and a series of local schools were established in various regions of the Seljuq domain. In this technique the surfaces of utilitarian metallic objects (candlesticks, ewers, basins, kettles, and so forth) were engraved, and then silver was inlaid in the cut-out areas to make the decorative design more clearly visible.",
  " Maq\u0101m\u0101t maq\u0101mah Maq\u0101m\u0101t  Manuscript illustration also became an important art. Scientific books, including the medical manuals of Pedanius Dioscorides and of Galen , or literary texts such as the picaresque adventures of a verbal genius known as the Maq\u0101m\u0101t , were produced with narrative illustrations throughout the text.",
  "All the technical novelties of the Seljuqs seem to have had one main purpose: to animate objects and books and to provide them with clearly visible and identifiable images. Even the austere art of calligraphy became occasionally animated with letters ending in human figures. The main centres for producing these arts were located in Iran and the Fertile Crescent. For reasons yet unknown, Egypt and Anatolia were far less involved. One reason may be that those two Seljuq provinces did not witness the same rise of an urban middle class as did Iran, Iraq, and Syria. It would seem from a large number of art objects whose patrons are known that the main market for these works of art was the mercantile bourgeoisie of the big cities and not, as has often been believed, the princes. Seljuq decorative arts and book illustration, therefore, reflect an urban taste.",
  " Maq\u0101m\u0101t Maq\u0101m\u0101t  The themes and motifs used were particularly numerous. In books they tend to be illustrations of the text, even if a manuscript such as the so-called Schefer Maq\u0101m\u0101t (1237; named for the French Orientalist and bibliophile Charles-Henri-Auguste Schefer [1820\u201398], who once owned it) sought to combine a strict narrative with a fairly naturalistic panorama of contemporary life. Narrative scenes taken from books or reflecting folk stories are also common on Persian ceramics. In all mediums, however, the predominant vocabulary of images is the one provided by the older art of princes, but its meaning is no longer that of illustrating the actual life of princes but rather that of symbolizing a good and happy life. The motifs, therefore, do not have to be taken literally. Next to princely and narrative themes there are depictions of scenes of daily life, astronomical motifs, and a myriad of topics that can be described but not understood.",
  "  While it is possible within certain limits to generalize about the subject matter of Seljuq art, regional stylistic definitions tend to be more valid. Thus, the bronzes produced in northeastern Iran in the 12th century are characterized by simple decorative compositions rather than by the very elaborate ones created by the so-called school of Mosul in Iraq during the 13th century. In general, the art of metalwork exhibits a consistently growing intricacy in composition and in details to the point that individual subjects are at times lost in overlapping planes of arabesques. Ceramic pieces of Iran have usually been classified according to a more or less fictitious provenance. K\u0101sh\u0101n ware exhibits a perfection of line in the depiction of moon-faced personages with heavily patterned clothes, while Rayy ceramic work is less sophisticated in design and execution but more vividly coloured. S\u0101veh and Gurg\u0101n are still other Iranian varieties of pottery. With the exception of K\u0101sh\u0101n ware, where dynasties of ceramicists are known, all these types of Iranian pottery were contemporary with each other. In Syria, Raqqah pottery imitated Iranian ceramic wares but with a far more limited vocabulary of designs.",
  "The main identifiable group of miniature painters is the so-called Baghdad school of the first half of the 13th century. The group should be called the Arab school because the subject matter and style employed could have been identified with any one of the major artistic centres of Egypt and the Fertile Crescent, and very little evidence currently exists to limit this school to one city. The miniatures painted by these artists are characterized by the colourful and often humorous way in which the urbanized Arab is depicted. The compositions, often lacking in any strong aesthetic intent, are documentary caricatures in which the artist has recorded the telling and recognizable gesture or a known and common setting or activity. In many images or compositional devices, one can recognize the impact of the richer Christian Mediterranean tradition of manuscript illumination. A greater attention to aesthetic considerations is apparent in the illustrated manuscript of the Persian epic Varqeh o-Golsh\u0101h , unique in the Seljuq period.",
  "The 11th to 13th centuries were not peaceful in the Maghrib. Amazigh (Berber) dynasties overthrew each other in Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula. The Christian Reconquista gradually diminished Muslim holdings in Spain and Portugal, and Tunisia was ruined during the Hil\u0101l\u012b invasion when Bedouin tribes were sent by the Fatimids to prevent local independence.",
  "    Two types of structures characterize the Almoravid (1056\u20131147) and Almohad (1130\u20131269) periods in Morocco and Spain. One comprises the large, severely designed Moroccan mosques such as those of Tinmel, of \u1e24asan in Rabat , or of the Kutubiyyah (Koutoubia) in Marrakech . They are all austere hypostyles with tall, massive, square minarets. The other distinctive type of architecture was that built for military purposes, including fortifications and, especially, massive city gates with low-slung horseshoe arches, such as the Oudaia Gate at Rabat (12th century) or the Rabat Gate at Marrakech (12th century). Palaces built in central Algeria by minor dynasties such as the Z\u012brids were more in the Fatimid tradition of Egypt than in the Almoravid and Almohad traditions of western Islam. Almost nothing is known or has been studied about North African arts other than architecture, because the puritanical world of the Berber dynasties did not foster the arts of luxury.",
  "In North Africa the artistic milieu did not change much in the 14th and 15th centuries. Hypostyle mosques such as the Great Mosque of Algiers continued to be built. Madrasahs were constructed with more elaborate plans; the B\u016b \u02bfIn\u0101niyyah madrasah at F\u00e8s is one of the few monumental buildings of the period. A few mausoleums were erected, such as the so-called Mar\u012bnid tombs near F\u00e8s (second half of the 14th century) or the complex of Chella at Rabat (mostly 14th century). Architectural decoration in stucco or sculpted stone was usually limited to elaborate geometric patterns, epigraphic themes, and a few vegetal motifs.",
  "    A stunning exception to the austerity of North African architecture exists in Spain in the Alhambra palace complex at Granada . The hill site of the Alhambra had been occupied by a citadel and possibly by a palace since the 11th century, but little of those earlier constructions has remained. In the 14th century two successive princes, Y\u016bsuf I and Mu\u1e25ammad V , transformed the hill into their official residence. Outside of a number of gates built like triumphal arches and several ruined forecourts, only three parts of the palace remain intact. First there is the long Court of the Myrtles, leading to the huge Hall of the Ambassadors, located in one of the exterior towers. This was the part of the Alhambra built by Y\u016bsuf I. Then there is the Court of the Lions, with its celebrated lion fountain in the centre. Numerous rooms open off this court, including the elaborately decorated Hall of the Two Sisters and the Hall of the Abencerrajes. The third part, slightly earlier than the first two, is the Generalife; it is a summer residence built higher up the hill and surrounded by gardens with fountains, pavilions, and portico walks.",
  "  The Alhambra is especially important because it is one of the few palaces to have survived from medieval Islamic times. It illustrates superbly a number of architectural concerns occasionally documented in literary references: the contrast between an unassuming exterior and a richly decorated interior to achieve an effect of secluded or private brilliance; the constant presence of water, either as a single, static basin or as a dynamic fountain; the inclusion of oratories and baths; and the lack of an overall plan (the units are simply attached to each other).",
  "The architectural decoration of the Alhambra was mostly of stucco. Some of it is flat, but the extraordinarily complex cupolas of muqarnas , as in the Hall of the Two Sisters, appear as huge multifaceted diadems. The decoration of the Alhambra becomes a sort of paradox as well as a tour de force. Weighty, elaborately decorated ceilings, for example, are supported by frail columns or by walls pierced with many windows (light permeates almost every part of the large, domed halls). Much of the design and decoration of the Alhambra is symbolically oriented. The poems that adorn the Alhambra as calligraphic ornamentation celebrate its cupolas as domes of heaven rotating around the prince sitting under them.",
  "Islamic art as such ceased to be produced in Spain after 1492, when Granada, the last Moorish kingdom in Spain, fell to the Christians, but the Islamic tradition continued in North Africa, which remained Muslim. In Morocco the so-called Shar\u012bfian dynasties from the 16th century onward ornamentally developed the artistic forms created in the 14th century.",
  "  Most of the best-known monuments of western Islamic art are buildings, although a very original calligraphy was developed. The other arts cannot be compared in wealth and importance either to what occurred elsewhere in Islam at the same time or to earlier objects created in Spain. There are some important examples of metalwork, wood inlaid with ivory , and a lustre-glaze pottery known as Hispano-Moresque ware . The fact that the latter was made in Valencia or M\u00e1laga after the termination of Muslim rule demonstrates that Islamic traditions in the decorative arts continued to be adhered to, if only partially. The term Mud\u00e9jar , therefore, is used to refer to all the things made in a Muslim style but under Christian rule. Numerous examples of Mud\u00e9jar art exist in ceramics and textiles, as well as in architectural monuments such as the synagogues of Toledo and the Alcazba in Sevilla (Seville), where even the name of the ruling Christian prince, Don Pedro, was written in Arabic letters. The Mud\u00e9jar spirit, in fact, permeated most of Spanish architectural ornament and decorative arts for centuries, and its influence can even be found in Spanish America.",
  "Mud\u00e9jar art must be carefully distinguished from Mozarabic art , the art of Christians under Muslim rule. Mozarabic art primarily flourished in Spain during the earlier periods of Muslim rule. Its major manifestations are architectural decorations, decorative objects, and illuminated manuscripts. Dating mostly from the 10th and 11th centuries, the celebrated illuminations for the commentary on the Revelation to John by an 8th-century Spanish abbot, Beatus of Li\u00e9bana, are purely Christian subjects treated in styles possibly influenced by Muslim miniature painting or book illustration. The most-celebrated example, known as the Saint-Sever Apocalypse , is in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris.",
  "The Mamluks were chiefly enslaved Turks and Circassians from the Caucasus and Central Asia who formed the mercenary army of the various feudal states of Syria and Egypt. During the 13th century the importance of this military caste grew as the older feudal order weakened and military commanders took over power, generally as nonhereditary sultans. They succeeded in arresting the Mongol onslaught in 1260 and, through a judicious but complicated system of alliance with the urban elite class, managed to maintain themselves in power in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria until 1517.",
  "During the Mamluk period Egypt and Syria were rich commercial emporiums. This wealth explains the quality and quantity of Mamluk art. Most of the existing monuments in the old quarters of Cairo , Damascus , Tripoli , and Aleppo are Mamluk; in Jerusalem almost everything visible on the \u1e24aram al-Shar\u012bf, with the exception of the Dome of the Rock , is Mamluk. Museum collections of Islamic art generally abound with Mamluk metalwork and glass. Some of the oldest remaining carpets are Mamluk. This creativity required, of course, more than wealth. It also required a certain will to transform wealth into art. This will was in part the desire of parvenu rulers and their cohorts to be remembered. Furthermore, architectural patronage flourished because of the institutionalization of the waqf , an economic system in which investments made for holy purposes were inalienable. This law allowed the wealthy to avoid confiscation of their properties at the whim of the caliph by investing their funds in religious institutions. In the Mamluk period, therefore, there was a multiplication of madrasahs, kh\u0101nq\u0101h s, rib\u0101\u1e6d s, and mosques, often with tombs of founders attached to them. The Mamluk establishment also repaired and kept up all the institutions, religious or secular, that had been inherited by them, as can be demonstrated by the well-documented repairs carried on in Jerusalem and Damascus.",
  "  The Mamluks created a monumental setting for Syria and Egypt that has lasted into the 21st century. It was at its most remarkable in architecture, and nearly 3,000 major monuments have been preserved or are known from texts in cities from the Euphrates to Cairo. No new architectural types came into being, although many more urban commercial buildings and private houses have been preserved than from previous centuries. The hypostyle form continued to be used for mosques and oratories, as in the Cairene mosques of Baybars I (1262\u201363), N\u0101\u1e63ir (1335), and Mu\u02beayyad Shaykh (1415\u201320). Madrasah s used eyv\u0101n s, and the justly celebrated madrasah of Sultan \u1e24asan in Cairo (1356\u201362) is one of the few perfect four- eyv\u0101n  madrasah s in the Islamic world. Mausoleums were squares or polygons covered with domes. In other words, there were only minor modifications in the typology of architecture, and even the 15th-century buildings with interiors totally covered with ornamentation have possible prototypes in the architecture of the Seljuqs. Yet there are formal and functional features that do distinguish Mamluk buildings. One is the tendency to build structures of different functions in a complex or cluster. Thus, the Qal\u0101\u02be\u016bn mosque (1284\u201385) in Cairo has a mausoleum, a madrasah, and a hospital erected as one architectural unit. Another characteristic is the tendency of Mamluk patrons to build their major monuments near each other. As a result, certain streets of Cairo , such as Bayn al-Qa\u1e63rayn, became galleries of architectural masterpieces. The plans of those buildings may have had to be adapted to the exigencies of the city, but their spectacular facades and minarets competed with each other for effect. From the second half of the 14th century onward, building space for mausoleums began to be limited in Cairo, and a vast complex of commemorative monuments was created in the city\u2019s western cemetery. In Aleppo and Damascus similar phenomena can be observed.",
  "Although Mamluk architecture was essentially conservative in its development of building types, more originality is evident in the constructional systems used, although traditional structural features continued to be employed\u2014e.g., cupolas raised on squinches, or more commonly, pendentives, barrel and groin vaults, and wooden ceilings covering large areas supported by columns and piers. The main innovations are of three kinds. First, minarets became particularly elaborate and, toward the end of the period, almost absurd in their ornamentation. Facades were huge, with overwhelming portals 25 to 35 feet (7.5 to 10.5 metres) high.",
  "  A second characteristically Mamluk feature was technical virtuosity in stone construction. At times this led to a superb purity of form, as in the Gate of the Cotton Merchants in Jerusalem or the complex of the Barq\u016bq mosque in Cairo. At other times, as in the Mamluk architecture of Baybars and Q\u0101\u02beit B\u0101y, there was an almost wild playfulness with forms. Another aspect of Mamluk masonry was the alternation of stones of different colours to provide variations on the surfaces of buildings.",
  "The third element of change in Mamluk art was perhaps the most important: almost all formal artistic achievements rapidly became part of the common vocabulary of the whole culture, thus ensuring high quality of construction and decorative technique throughout the period.",
  "With the exception of portals and qiblah walls, architectural decoration was usually subordinated to the architectural elements of the design. Generally, the material of construction (usually stone) was carved with ornamental motifs. Stucco decoration was primarily used in early Mamluk architecture, while coloured tile was a late decorative device that was rarely employed.",
  "Like architecture, the other arts of the Mamluk period achieved a high level of technical perfection but were often lacking in originality. The so-called  Baptist\u00e8re de Saint Louis  (c. 1310) is the most impressive example of inlaid metalwork preserved from this period. Several Mamluk illustrated manuscripts, such as the Maq\u0101m\u0101t (1334) in the National Library, Vienna, display an amazing ornamental sense in the use of colour on gold backgrounds. Mamluk mosque lamps provide some of the finest examples of medieval glass. The wooden objects made by Mamluk craftsmen were widely celebrated for the quality of their painted, inlaid, or carved designs. And the bold inscriptions that decorate the hundreds of remaining bronzes testify to the Mamluk mastery of calligraphy.",
  "Seen from the vantage point of contemporary or later chronicles, the 13th century in Iran was a period of destructive wars and invasions. Such cities as Balkh, N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br, and Rayy, which had been centres of Islamic culture for nearly six centuries, were eradicated as the Mongol army swept through Iran. The turning point toward some sort of stability took place in 1295 with the accession of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Gh\u0101z\u0101n to the Mongol throne. Under him and his successors (the Il-Khan dynasty ), order was reestablished throughout Iran, and cities in northeastern Iran, especially Tabr\u012bz and Sol\u1e6d\u0101n\u012byeh, became the main creative centres of the new Mongol regime. At Tabr\u012bz, for example, the Rash\u012bd\u012byeh (a sort of academy of sciences and arts to which books, scholars, and ideas from all over the world were collected) was established in the early 14th century.",
  "  Existing under the Mongol rulers were a number of secondary dynasties that flourished in various provinces of Iran: the Jal\u0101yirid dynasty , centred in Baghdad, controlled most of western Iran; the Mo\u1e93affarid dynasty of southwestern Iran contained the cities of E\u1e63fah\u0101n , Yazd , and Sh\u012br\u0101z ; and the Karts reigned in Khor\u0101s\u0101n . Until the last decade of the 14th century, however, all the major cultural centres were in western Iran. Under Timur (1336\u20131405) and his successors (the Timurid dynasty ), however, northeastern Iran, especially the cities of Samarkand and Her\u0101t , became focal points of artistic and intellectual activity. But Timurid culture affected the whole of Iran either directly or through minor local dynasties. Many Timurid monuments, therefore, are found in western or southern Iran.",
  "Stylistically, Il-Khanid architecture is defined best by buildings such as the mosque of Var\u0101m\u012bn (1322\u201326) and the mausoleums at Sarakhs, Merv , R\u0101d-K\u0101n, and Mar\u0101gheh . In all those examples, the elements of architectural composition, decoration, and construction that had been developed earlier were refined by Il-Khanid architects. Eyv\u0101n s were shallower but better integrated with the courts, facades were more thoughtfully composed, the muqarnas became more linear and varied, and coloured tiles were used to enhance the building\u2019s character.",
  "The architectural masterpiece of the Il-Khanid period is the mausoleum of \u00d6ljeit\u00fc at Sol\u1e6d\u0101niyyeh. With its double system of galleries, eight minarets, large blue-tiled dome, and an interior measuring 80 feet (25 metres), it is clear that the building was intended to be imposing. Il-Khanid attention to impressiveness of scale also accounted for the \u02bfAl\u012b Sh\u0101h mosque in Tabr\u012bz, whose eyv\u0101n measuring 150 by 80 by 100 feet (45 by 25 by 30 metres) was meant to be the largest ever built. The eyv\u0101n vault collapsed almost immediately after it had been constructed, but its walls, 35 feet (10 metres) thick, remain as a symbol of the grandiose taste of the Il-Khanids. In the regions of E\u1e63fah\u0101n and Yazd numerous smaller mosques (often with unusual plans) and less ostentatious mausoleums, as well as palaces with elaborate gardens, were built in the 14th century. Those buildings were constructed to provide a monumental setting for the Islamic faith and to demonstrate the authority of the state.",
  "The Timurid period began architecturally in 1390 with the sanctuary of A\u1e25mad Yasav\u012b in Turkistan. Between 1390 and the last works of Sultan \u1e24usayn B\u0101yqar\u0101 almost a century later, hundreds of buildings were constructed at Her\u0101t, many of which have been preserved. The most spectacular examples of Timurid architecture are found in Samarkand, Her\u0101t, Mashhad, Khargird, Tay\u0101b\u0101d, Baku , and Tabr\u012bz, although important Timurid structures were also erected in southern Iran.",
  "Architectural projects were well patronized by the Timurids as a means to commemorate their respective reigns. Every ruler or local governor constructed his own sanctuaries, mosques, and, especially, memorial buildings dedicated to holy men of the past. While the Sh\u0101h-e Zendah in Samarkand\u2014a long street of mausoleums comparable to the Mamluk cemetery of Cairo\u2014is perhaps the most accessible of the sites of Timurid commemorative architecture, more spectacular ones are to be seen at Mashhad , Torbat-e J\u0101m, and Maz\u0101r-e Shar\u012bf . The Timurid princes also erected mausoleums for themselves, such as the G\u016br-e Am\u012br and the \u02bfIshrat-Kh\u0101neh in Samarkand.",
  "Major Timurid buildings\u2014such as the mosque of B\u012bb\u012b Kh\u0101nom and the G\u016br-e Am\u012br mausoleum, both in Samarkand; the mosque of Gowhar Sh\u0101d in Mashhad; or the madrasahs at Khargird and Her\u0101t\u2014are all characterized by strong axial symmetry. Often the facade on the inner court repeats the design of the outer facade, and minarets are used to frame the composition. Changes took place in the technique of dome construction. The muqarnas was not entirely abandoned but was often replaced by a geometrically rigorous net of intersecting arches that could be adapted to various shapes by modifying the width or span of the dome. The Khargird madrasah and the \u02bfIshrat-Kh\u0101neh mausoleum in Samarkand are particularly striking examples of this structural development. The Timurids also made use of double domes on high drums.",
  "  In the Timurid period the use of colour in architecture reached a high point. Every architectural unit was divided, on both the exterior and interior, into panels of brilliantly coloured tiles that sometimes were mixed with stucco or terra-cotta architectural decorations.",
  " History of the World History of the World  A new period of Persian painting began in the Mongol era; even though here and there one can recognize the impact of Seljuq painting, on the whole it is a limited one. Although the new style was primarily expressed in miniature painting, it is known from literary sources that mural painting flourished as well. Masterpieces of Persian literature were illustrated: first the Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh (\u201cBook of Kings\u201d) by the 11th-century poet Ferdows\u012b and then, from the second half of the 14th century, lyrical and mystical works, primarily those by the 12th-century poet Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b . Historical texts or chronicles such as Rash\u012bd al-D\u012bn\u2019s J\u0101mi\u02bf al-taw\u0101r\u012bkh (\u201cThe Collection of Chronicles\u201d) were also illustrated, especially in the early Mongol period.",
  "The first major monument of Persian painting in the Mongol period is a group of manuscripts of the J\u0101mi\u02bf al-taw\u0101r\u012bkh . The miniatures are historical narrative scenes. Stylistically, they are related to Chinese painting\u2014an influence introduced by the Mongols during the Il-Khanid period.",
  " Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh  Chinese influence can still be discovered in the masterpiece of 14th-century Persian painting, the so-called Demotte  Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh  (named for the French dealer Georges Demotte who destroyed the binding in the early 20th century), also called the Great Mongol Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh . Illustrated between 1320 and 1360, its 56 preserved miniatures have been dispersed all over the world. The compositional complexity of those paintings can be attributed to the fact that several painters probably were involved in the illustration of the manuscript and that the artists drew from a wide variety of different stylistic sources (e.g., Chinese, European, local Iranian traditions). Its main importance lies in the fact that it is the earliest known illustrative work that sought to depict in a strikingly dramatic fashion the meaning of the Iranian epic. Its battle scenes, its descriptions of fights with monsters, its enthronement scenes are all powerful representations of the colourful and often cruel legend of Iranian kingship. The artists also tried to express human powerlessness when confronted by fate in a series of mourning and death scenes.",
  " Diw\u0101n Diw\u0101n  The Demotte Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh is but the most remarkable of a whole series of 14th-century manuscripts, all of which suggest an art of painting in search of a coherent style. At the very end of the period, a manuscript such as that of the poems of Sultan A\u1e25mad still exhibits an effective variety of established themes, while some of the miniatures of the period illustrate the astounding variety of styles studied or copied by Persian masters.",
  " Prince Hum\u0101y at the Gate of Hum\u0101yun\u2019s Castle Prince Hum\u0101y at the Gate of Hum\u0101yun\u2019s Castle Khamseh  A more organized and stylistically coherent period in Persian painting began about 1396 with the Khw\u0101ju Kerm\u0101n\u012b manuscript and culminated between 1420 and 1440 in the paintings produced by the Her\u0101t school , an academy created by Timur\u2019s son Sh\u0101h Rokh and developed by Sh\u0101h Rokh\u2019s son Baysunqur M\u012brz\u0101 to codify, copy, and illustrate classical Iranian literature . Although several Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh s are known from this time, the mood of those manuscripts is no longer epic but lyrical. Puppetlike figures almost unemotionally engage in a variety of activities always set in an idealized garden or palace depicted against a rich gold background. It is a world of sensuous pleasure that also embodies the themes of a mystically interpreted lyrical poetry, for what is represented is not the real world but a divine paradise in the guise of a royal palace or garden. Those miniatures easily became clich\u00e9s, for later artists endlessly repeated stereotyped formulas. But at its best, as in the illustrated manuscripts of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b (Ni\u1e93\u0101m\u012b) held by New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art , this style of Persian painting succeeds in defining something more than mere ornamental colourfulness. It expresses in its controlled lyricism a fascinating search for the divine, similar to the search of such epic characters as those presented in the works of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b, R\u016bm\u012b , or \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93 , at times earthly and vulgar, at other times quite ambiguous and hermetic, but often providing a language for the ways in which human beings can talk about God.",
  " \u1e92afar-n\u0101meh \u1e92afar-n\u0101meh  Another major change in Persian painting occurred during the second half of the 15th century at Her\u0101t under \u1e24usayn B\u0101yqar\u0101. This change is associated with the first major painter of Islamic art, Behz\u0101d . Many problems of attribution are still posed about Behz\u0101d\u2019s art. In the examples that follow, works by his school, as well as images by the master\u2019s own hand, are included. In the Garrett \u1e92afar-n\u0101meh (c. 1490, housed at Princeton University ), the Egyptian Cairo National Library\u2019s B\u016bst\u0101n (1488), or the British Museum\u2019s Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b (1493\u201394), the stereotyped formulas of the earlier lyric style were endowed with new vitality. Behz\u0101d\u2019s interest in observing his environment resulted in the introduction of more realistic poses and the introduction of numerous details of daily life or genre elements. His works also reflect a concern for a psychological interpretation of the scenes and events depicted. It is thus not by chance that portraits have been attributed to Behz\u0101d.",
  " Persian art of the Mongol period differs in a very important way from any of the other traditions of the middle period of Islamic art. Even though Iran, like all other areas at that time, was not ethnically homogeneous, its art tended to be uniquely \u201cnational.\u201d In architecture, nationalism was mostly a matter of function, for during this period the Shi\u02bfah grew in importance, and new monumental settings were required for their holy places. Iranian individualism is especially apparent in painting, in which Chinese and other foreign styles were consistently adapted to express intensely Iranian subjects, thereby creating a uniquely Persian style.",
  "The last period of an Islamic artistic expression created within a context of political and intellectual independence was centred in the Ottoman , Safavid , and Mughal empires. Although culturally very different from each other, those three imperial states shared a common past and a common consciousness of the nature of their ancestry and of the artistic forms associated with it. Painters and architects moved from one empire to the other, especially from Iran to India; Ottoman princes wrote Persian poetry , and Safavid rulers spoke Turkish . But most of all, they were aware of the fact that they were much closer to each other than to any non-Islamic cultural entity. However different their individual artistic forms may have been, they collected each other\u2019s works, exchanged gifts, and felt that they belonged to the same world.",
  "The Ottomans were originally only one of the small Turkmen principalities ( beylik s) that sprang up in Anatolia about 1300, after the collapse of Seljuq rule. In many ways, all the beylik s shared the same culture, but it was the extraordinary political and social attributes of the Ottomans that led them eventually to swallow up the other kingdoms, to conquer the Balkans , to take Constantinople (now Istanbul ) in 1453, and to control almost the whole of the Arab world by 1520. Only in the 19th century did this complex empire begin to crumble. Thus, while Ottoman art, especially architecture, is best known through the monuments in Turkey , there is, in fact, evidence of Ottoman art extending from Algiers to Cairo in North Africa, to Damascus in the Levant, and in the Balkans from Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina, to Sofia , Bulgaria.",
  "The grand tradition of Ottoman architecture, established in the 16th century, was derived from two main sources. One was the rather complex development of new architectural forms that occurred all over Anatolia, especially at Manisa , \u0130znik , Bursa , and Sel\u00e7uk in the 14th and early 15th centuries. In addition to the usual mosques, mausoleums, and madrasahs, a number of buildings called tekke s (Arabic z\u0101wiyah s, Persian kh\u0101nq\u0101h s) were constructed to house dervishes (members of mystical fraternities) and other holy men who lived communally. The tekke (or zeviye ) was often joined to a mosque or mausoleum. The entire complex was then called a k\u00fclliye . All those buildings continued to develop the domed, central-plan structure constructed by the Seljuqs in Anatolia.",
  "The other source of Ottoman architecture is Christian art. The Byzantine tradition, especially as embodied in Hagia Sophia , became a major source of inspiration. Byzantine influence appears in such features as stone and brick used together or in the use of pendentive dome construction. Also artistically influential were the contacts that the early Ottomans had with Italy. Thus, in several mosques at Bursa, Turkey, there are stylistic parallels in the designs of the exterior facade and of windows, gates, and roofs to features found in Italian architecture. A distinctive feature of Ottoman architecture is that it drew from both Islamic and European artistic traditions and was, therefore, a part of both.",
  "The apogee of Ottoman architecture was achieved in the great series of k\u00fclliye s and mosques that still dominate the Istanbul skyline: the Fatih k\u00fclliye (1463\u201370), the Bayezid Mosque (after 1491), the Selim Mosque (1522), the \u015eehzade k\u00fclliye (1548), and the S\u00fcleyman k\u00fclliye (after 1550). The \u015eehzade and S\u00fcleyman k\u00fclliye s were built by Sinan , the greatest Ottoman architect, whose masterpiece is the Selim Mosque at Edirne , Turkey (1569\u201375). All those buildings exhibit total clarity and logic in both plan and elevation; every part has been considered in relation to the whole, and each architectural element has acquired a hierarchic function in the total composition. Whatever is unnecessary has been eliminated. This simplicity of design in the late 15th and 16th centuries has often been attributed to the fact that Sinan and many other Ottoman architects were first trained as military engineers. Everything in those buildings was subordinated to an imposing central dome. A sort of cascade of descending half domes, vaults, and ascending buttresses leads the eye up and down the building\u2019s exterior. Minarets, slender and numerous, frame the exterior composition, while the open space of the surrounding courts prevents the building from being swallowed by the surrounding city. These masterpieces of Ottoman architecture seem to be the final perfection of two great traditions: a stylistic and aesthetic tradition that had been indigenous to Istanbul since the construction of the Byzantine church of Hagia Sophia in the 6th century and the other Islamic tradition of domical construction dating to the 10th century.",
  "  The tragedy of Ottoman architecture is that it never managed to renew its 16th-century brilliance. Later buildings, such as the impressive Sultan Ahmed mosque in Istanbul, were mostly variations on Sinan\u2019s architecture, and sometimes there were revivals of older building types, especially in the provinces. Occasionally, as in the early 18th-century N\u00fbruosman mosque in Istanbul, interesting new variants appear illustrating the little-known Turkish Baroque style. The latter, however, is more visible in ornamental details or in smaller buildings, especially the numerous fountains built in Istanbul in the 18th century. The sources of the Turkish Baroque are probably to be sought in the Baroque architecture of Vienna and the bordering Austro-Hungarian states. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, a consistent Europeanization of a local tradition occurs in the Ottoman Empire.",
  "While mosques and k\u00fclliye s are the most characteristic monuments of Ottoman architecture, important secular buildings were also built: baths, caravansaries, and especially the huge palace complex of Topkap\u0131 Saray at Istanbul, in which 300 years of royal architecture are preserved in its elaborate pavilions, halls, and fountains.",
  "  Architectural decoration was generally subordinated to the structural forms or architectonic features of the building. A wide variety of themes and techniques originating from many different sources were used. One decorative device, the Ottoman version of colour tile decoration, deserves particular mention, for it succeeds in transforming smaller buildings such as the mosque of R\u00fcstem Pa\u015fa in Istanbul into a visual spectacle of brilliant colours. The history and development of this type of ceramic decoration is intimately tied to the complex and much-controverted problem of the growth of several distinctive Ottoman schools of pottery: \u0130znik, Rhodian, and Damascus ware. Both in technique and in design, Ottoman ceramics are the only major examples of pottery produced in the late Islamic period.",
  "  Ottoman miniature painting does not compare in quality to Persian painting, which originally influenced the Turkish school. Yet Ottoman miniatures do have a character of their own, either in the almost folk art effect of religious images or in the precise depictions of such daily events as military expeditions or great festivals. Among the finest examples of the latter is the manuscript Surname-i Vehbi painted by Abd\u00fclcelil Levn\u00ee in the early 18th century.",
  "The production of metalwork, wood inlaid with ivory, Ushak carpets , and textiles flourished under the Ottomans, both in Istanbul workshops sponsored by the sultan and in numerous provincial centres. The influence of those ornamental objects on European decorative arts from the 16th through the 19th century was considerable.",
  "The Safavid dynasty was founded by Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl I (ruled 1501\u201324). The art of this dynasty was especially noteworthy during the reigns of \u1e6cahm\u0101sp I (1524\u201376) and \u02bfAbb\u0101s I (1588\u20131629). This phase of the Safavid period also marked the last significant development of Islamic art in Iran, for after the middle of the 17th century original creativity disappeared in all mediums. Rugs and objects in silver, gold, and enamel continued to be made and exhibited a considerable technical virtuosity, even when they were lacking in inventiveness.",
  "The Safavids abandoned Central Asia and northeastern Iran to a new Uzbek dynasty that maintained the Timurid style in many buildings (especially at Bukhara) and briefly sponsored a minor and derivative school of painting. Only the great sanctuary of Mashhad was being kept up and built up, but, like many of the other religious sanctuaries of the time\u2014 Qom , Najaf , Karbala \u2014it is still far too little known to lend itself to coherent analysis. This was the time when Shi\u02bfism became a state religion, and for the first time in Islam there appeared an organized ecclesiastical system rather than the more or less loose spiritual and practical leadership of old. The main centres of the Safavid empire were Tabr\u012bz and Ardab\u012bl in the northwest, with Kazvin in the central region and, especially, E\u1e63fah\u0101n in the west. The Safavid period, like the Ottoman era, was an imperial age, and therefore there is hardly a part of Iran where either Safavid buildings or major Safavid restorations cannot be found. The dynasty spent much money and effort on the building of bridges, roads, and caravansaries to encourage trade.",
  "The best-known Safavid monuments are located at E\u1e63fah\u0101n, where \u02bfAbb\u0101s I built a whole new city. According to one description, it contained 162 mosques, 48 madrasahs, 1,802 commercial buildings, and 283 baths. Most of those buildings no longer survive, but the structures that remain constitute some of the finest monuments of Islamic architecture.",
  "At the centre of E\u1e63fah\u0101n is the Mayd\u0101n-e Sh\u0101h (now Mayd\u0101n-e Em\u0101m), a large open space, about 1,670 by 520 feet (510 by 158 metres), originally surrounded by trees. Used for polo games and parades, it could be illuminated with 50,000 lamps. Each side of the mayd\u0101n was provided with the monumental facade of a building. On one of the smaller sides was the entrance to a large mosque, the celebrated Masjed-e Sh\u0101h (now Masjed-e Em\u0101m). On the other side was the entrance into the bazaar or marketplace. On the longer sides were the small funerary mosque of Shaykh Lu\u1e6df All\u0101h (Sheikh Lotfoll\u0101h) and, facing it, the \u02bfAl\u012b Q\u0101p\u016b, the \u201cLofty Gate,\u201d the first unit of a succession of palaces and gardens that extended beyond the mayd\u0101n , most of which have now disappeared except for the Chehel Sot\u016bn (\u201cForty Columns\u201d), a palace built as an audience hall. The \u02bfAl\u012b Q\u0101p\u016b was, in its lower floors, a semipublic place to which petitions could be brought, while its upper floors were a world of pure fantasy\u2014a succession of rooms, halls, and balconies overlooking the city, which were purely for the prince\u2019s pleasure.",
  "The Mayd\u0101n-e Em\u0101m unites in a single composition all the concerns of medieval Islamic architecture: prayer, commemoration, princely pleasure, trade, and spatial effect. None of the hundreds of other remaining Safavid monuments can match its historical importance, and in it also are found the major traits of Safavid construction and decoration. The forms are traditional, for the most part, and, even in vaulting techniques and the use of coloured tiles, it is to Timurid art that the Safavids looked for their models. The Persian architects of the early 17th century sought to achieve a monumentality in exterior spatial composition (an interesting parallel to the interior spaciousness created at the same time by the Ottomans); a logical precision in vaulting, which was successful in the Masjed-e Em\u0101m but rapidly led to cheap effects or to stucco imitations; and a colouristic brilliance that has made the domes and portals of E\u1e63fah\u0101n justly famous.",
  "In the 16th and 17th centuries, possibly for the first time in Islamic art, painters were conscious of historical styles\u2014even self-conscious. Miniatures from the past were collected, copied, and imitated. Patronage, however, was fickle. A royal whim would gather painters together or exile them. Many names of painters have been preserved, and there is little doubt that the whim of patrons was being countered by the artists\u2019 will to be socially and economically independent as well as individually recognized for their artistic talents. Too many different impulses, therefore, existed in Safavid Iran for painting to follow any clear line of development.",
  "Three major painting styles, or schools (excluding a number of interesting provincial schools), existed in the Safavid period. One school of miniature painting is exemplified by such masterpieces as the Houghton Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh (completed in 1537), the J\u0101m\u012b  Haft owrang (1556\u20131665), and the illustrations to stories from \u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93 . However different they are from each other, those large, colourful miniatures all were executed in a grand manner. Their compositions are complex, individual faces appear in crowded masses, there is much diversification in landscape, and, despite a few ferocious details of monsters or of strongly caricatured poses and expressions, these book illustrations are concerned with an idealized vision of life. The sources of this school lie with the Timurid academy. Behz\u0101d , Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad , Sheykhz\u0101deh, M\u012br Sayyid \u02bfAl\u012b , \u0100q\u0101 M\u012brak , and Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Mu\u1e63avv\u012br continued and modified, each in his own way, the ideal of a balance between an overall composition and precise rendering of details.",
  " Khosrow Makes His Elephant Trample the Enemy Khosrow Makes His Elephant Trample the Enemy Khosrow o Sh\u012br\u012bn  The miniatures of the second tradition of Safavid painting seem at first to be like a detail out of the work of the previously discussed school. The same purity of colour, elegance of poses, interest in details, and assertion of the individual figure is found. Rez\u0101 \u02bfAbb\u0101s\u012b (active in the late 16th and early 17th century) excelled in these extraordinary portrayals of poets, musicians, courtiers, and aristocratic life in general.",
  "In both traditions of painting, the beautiful personages depicted frequently are satirized; this note of satirical criticism is even more pronounced in portraiture of the time. But it is in pen or brush drawings, mostly dating from the 17th century, that the third aspect of Safavid painting appeared: an interest in genre, or the depiction of minor events of daily life (e.g., a washerwoman at work, a tailor sewing, an animal). With stunning precision, Safavid artists showed a whole society falling apart with a cruel sympathy totally absent from the literary documents of the time.",
  "While architecture and painting were the main artistic vehicles of the Safavids, the making of textiles and carpets was also of great importance. It is in the 16th century that a thitherto primarily nomadic and folk medium of the decorative arts was transformed into an expression of royal and urban tasks by the creation of court workshops. The predominantly geometric themes of earlier Iranian carpets were not abandoned entirely but tended to be replaced by vegetal, animal, and even occasional human motifs. Great schools of carpet making developed particularly at Tabr\u012bz , K\u0101shan\u0304 , and Kerm\u0101n. ",

  "The art of the Mughals was similar to that of the Ottomans in that it was a late imperial art of Muslim princes. Both styles were rooted in several centuries (at least from the 13th century onward) of adaptation of Islamic functions to indigenous forms. It was in the 14th-century architecture of South Asian sites such as Tughluqabad, Gaur, and Ahmadabad that a uniquely Indian type of Islamic hypostyle mosque was created, with a triple axial nave, corner towers, axial minarets, and cupolas. It was also during those centuries that the first mausoleums set in scenically spectacular locations were built. By then the conquering Muslims had fully learned how to utilize local methods of construction, and they adapted South Asian decorative techniques and motifs.",
  "Mughal art was in continuous contact with Iran or, rather, with the Timurid world of the second half of the 15th century. The models and the memories were in Her\u0101t or Samarkand, but the artists were raided from Safavid Iran, and the continuous flow of painters from Iran to the Mughal Empire is a key factor in understanding Mughal painting.",
  "The mausoleum of Hum\u0101y\u016bn in Delhi (1570; in 1993 designated a UNESCO World Heritage site), the city of Fatehpur Sikri (founded 1569; in 1986 designated a World Heritage site), and the Taj Mahal at Agra (1631\u201353; in 1983 designated a World Heritage site) summarize the development of Mughal architecture. In all three examples it can be seen that what Mughal architecture brought to the Islamic tradition (other than traditional Indian themes, especially in decoration) was technical perfection in the use of red sandstone or marble as building and decorative materials.",
  "In Mughal painting, the kind of subject that tended to be illustrated was remarkably close to those used in Safavid history books\u2014legendary stories, local events, portraits, genre scenes. What evolved quickly was a new manner of execution, and this style can be seen as early as about 1567, when the celebrated manuscript D\u0101st\u0101n-e Am\u012br \u1e24amzeh (\u201cStories of Am\u012br \u1e24amzeh\u201d) was painted (some 200 miniatures remain and are found in most major collections of Indian miniatures, especially at the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). Traditional Iranian themes\u2014battles, receptions, feasts\u2014acquired monumentality, not only because of the inordinate size of the images but also because almost all of the objects and figures depicted were seen in terms of mass rather than line. Something of the colourfulness of Iranian painting was lost, but instead images acquired a greater expressive power. Mughal portraiture gave more of a sense of the individual than did the portraits of the Safavids. As in a celebrated representation of a dying courtier in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts , Mughal drawings could be poignantly naturalistic. Mood was important to the Mughal artist; in many paintings of animals there is a playful mood, and a sensuous mood is evident in the first Muslim images to glorify the female body and the erotic.",
  "In summary it can be said that the Mughals produced an art of extraordinary stylistic contrasts that reflected the complexities of its origins and of its aristocratic patronage.",
  "It is extremely difficult to decide when, how, and to what extent European art began to affect the art of the traditional Muslim world. Ottoman architecture was from the beginning affected by Western influences. In Mughal India, European landscapes and Western spatial concerns influenced painting in the 18th century, and Persian painting has exhibited constant Western influence since the 17th century. Thus, Islamic art began to be affected by European traditions before Europe began (in the 18th and 19th centuries) its conquests of most of the Muslim world. Because the Ottomans ruled North Africa (except Morocco), Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, as well as the Balkans, much of the Muslim world was first introduced to \u201cmodern\u201d European art through its adaptation in Istanbul or in other major Ottoman cities such as Smyrna (now \u0130zmir ) or Alexandria .",
  "European influence tended to have been mostly limited to architecture. Nineteenth-century European engineers and architects, for example, adapted modern structural technology and decorative styles to local Islamic needs or idioms: the S\u016bq al-\u1e24am\u012bdiyyah bazaar in Damascus was built with steel roofing; the Hejaz railway station at Damascus was decorated in a sort of Eastern Art Nouveau style.",
  "During actual European occupation of Muslim territory, there was a conscious revival of traditional decorative arts, but new techniques were often employed. This especially occurred in India and Morocco, where the retail success of an art object depended less on the local tradition than on the taste of the Europeans. What was romantic to a European, therefore, was no longer part of the world of the newly enriched and Europeanized Muslim. Much of the Europeanized architecture was drab and pretentious. The only real artistic accomplishment of this period was in the preservation and encouragement of the traditional techniques and designs of the decorative arts, which often had to be maintained artificially through government subsidies.",
  "During the period of occupation it was questioned whether alien techniques necessarily brought with them new forms. This mood was clearly expressed in literature but less so in the visual arts, because the quality of Muslim art had deteriorated so much in the decades preceding European arrival that there was no longer a lively creative force to maintain. As various schools based on the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris were formed, however, the faculties and the students suffered from constant uncertainty as to whether they should preserve an art that was mostly artisanal or revolutionize it altogether.",
  "It is much more difficult to define in broad terms the characteristics of art in Muslim countries after the formation of independent countries in the 1940s and \u201950s. Extensive planning programs and building projects were undertaken in even the poorest countries, and the wealthy Arab states as well as prerevolutionary Iran transformed their traditional cities and countryside with spectacular modern complexes ranging from housing projects to universities. Many of those buildings were planned and constructed by Western firms and architects, and some are mere copies of European and American models, ill-adapted to the physical conditions and visual traditions of the Muslim world. Others are interesting and even sensitive projects: spectacular and technically innovative, such as the InterContinental Hotel in Mecca (designed by German architects Rolf Gutbrod and Frei Otto ) and the Hajj Terminal at the King Abdulaziz International Airport at Jeddah , Saudi Arabia (designed by the U.S. firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill); or intelligent and imaginative, such as the government buildings of Dhaka , Bangladesh (designed by American architect Louis I. Kahn ), or the numerous buildings designed by Frenchman Andr\u00e9 Ravereau in Mali and Algeria. Furthermore, within the Muslim world emerged several schools of architects that adopted modes of an international language to suit local conditions. The oldest of those schools are in Turkey.",
  "Major Muslim contributors to a contemporary Islamic architecture include the Iranians Nader Ardalan and Kamran Diba, the Iraqis Rifat Chaderji and Mohamed Makiya, the Jordanian Rasem Badran, and the Bangladeshi Mazharul Islam. A unique message was transmitted by the visionary Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy, who, in eloquent and prophetic terms, urged that the traditional forms and techniques of vernacular architecture be studied and adapted to contemporary needs. Directly or indirectly, his work inspired many young architects in the Muslim world and led to a host of fascinating private houses, mosques, and educational facilities. The Aga Khan Award for Architecture was instituted to encourage genuine and contemporary architectural innovation in Muslim lands.",
