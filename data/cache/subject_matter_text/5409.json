  "  albedo , fraction of light that is reflected by a body or surface. It is commonly used in astronomy to describe the reflective properties of planets , satellites , and asteroids . It is an important consideration in climatology since recent albedo decreases in the Arctic have increased heat  absorption at the surface.",
  "Albedo is usually differentiated into two general types: normal albedo and Bond albedo. The former, also called normal reflectance, is a measure of a surface\u2019s relative brightness when illuminated and observed vertically. The normal albedo of snow , for example, is nearly 1.0, whereas that of charcoal is about 0.04. Investigators frequently rely on observations of normal albedo to determine the surface compositions of satellites and asteroids. The albedo, diameter, and distance of such objects together determine their brightness. If the asteroids Ceres and Vesta , for example, could be observed at the same distance, Vesta would be the brighter of the two by roughly 10 percent. Though Vesta\u2019s diameter measures less than half that of Ceres, Vesta appears brighter because its albedo is about 0.35, whereas that of Ceres is only 0.09.",
  "Changes in Earth\u2019s global albedo can affect global warming . Sea-ice loss in the Arctic since the end of the 20th century has lowered the region\u2019s albedo, decreasing the region\u2019s ability to reflect incoming sunlight while increasing its ability to absorb energy from sunlight. Researchers note that the Arctic\u2019s falling albedo is producing a positive temperature feedback \u2014in which greater energy absorption at the surface has led to increases in available heat, which, in turn melts additional ice , thereby decreasing the region\u2019s albedo further.",
  "Bond albedo, defined as the fraction of the total incident solar radiation reflected by a planet back to space, is a measure of the planet\u2019s energy balance. (It is so named for the American astronomer George P. Bond, who in 1861 published a comparison of the brightness of the Sun , the Moon , and Jupiter .) The value of Bond albedo depends on the spectrum of the incident radiation because such albedo is defined over the entire range of wavelengths . Earth-orbiting satellites have been used to measure Earth\u2019s Bond albedo. The most recent values obtained are approximately 0.29. The Moon, which has a very tenuous atmosphere and no clouds , has an albedo of 0.12. By contrast, that of Venus , which is covered by dense clouds, is 0.75."
