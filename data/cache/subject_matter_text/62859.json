  "Reading was a Danish encampment as early as 871. Between the 12th and 16th centuries Reading was dominated by a struggle for privileges between the abbey and the emergent merchants\u2019 guild. The town suffered severely in the English Civil Wars of the mid-17th century. By the 17th century the town\u2019s trade, notably in clothing, had begun to decline. In the 18th century the chief trade was in malt.",
  "The first town charter is that of Henry III (1253), confirmed and amplified by succeeding sovereigns. The government charter until 1835 was that of Charles I (1639), incorporating the town under the title of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses. The market, held on Saturday, can be traced to the reign of Henry III.",
  "In the public gardens are the ruins of a Benedictine abbey, founded by Henry I in 1121 and once ranking as third in all England; it was dissolved by Henry VIII , who turned it into a palace, but then it was destroyed during the English Civil Wars.

In Reading Gaol, adjoining the ruins, Oscar Wilde wrote the long letter later revised and published as De Profundis ; the long poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol came later.",
