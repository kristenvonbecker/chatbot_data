  " settling , in soil mechanics, refers to sedimentation; i.e. , the settling out of solid particles from suspension in water. The velocity of settling depends on the size, shape, and density of the particles, and on the viscosity of the water. Particles may be classified in size by relative settling rates.",
  "Settling also refers to movement of structures located above deep beds of soft clay. This may continue for several years after a structure is completed. The mineral particles in the clay form an open compressible structure, the voids of which are filled with water, the flow being restricted by the smallness of the openings between voids. When first applied, the load is carried mainly by relatively incompressible water. Settling takes place as the load stress is slowly transferred from the water to the clay structure."
