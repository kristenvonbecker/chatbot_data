  " still-life painting , depiction of inanimate objects for the sake of their qualities of form, colour, texture, and composition. Although decorative fresco murals and mosaics with still-life subjects occasionally appeared in antiquity, it was not until the Renaissance that still life emerged as an independent painting genre, rather than existing primarily as a subsidiary element in a composition. Early Netherlandish still-life paintings depicted skulls, candles, and hourglasses as allegories of mortality, or combined flowers and fruits of all seasons to symbolize nature\u2019s cycle ( see  vanitas ). An interest in observing and then realistically representing the material details of the environment, the rise of a wealthy middle class who desired art works to decorate their homes, and an increasing demand for secular subjects in painting other than portraiture as a result of the prolonged effects of the Reformation\u2014all were factors that contributed to the rise of still-life painting in the 16th and 17th centuries. The painting generally considered to be the first still life is a work by the Italian painter Jacopo de\u2019Barbari painted 1504. The \u201cgolden age\u201d of still-life painting occurred in the Lowlands during the 17th century.",
  "Among the most famous Dutch and Flemish painters who specialized in still-life subjects were Willem Heda , Willem Kalf , Jan Fyt , Frans Snyders , Jan Weenix , Melchior d\u2019Hondecoeter , Jan van Huysum , and the de Heem family. From the 18th century until the rise of Nonobjective painting after World War II, France became the centre of still-life painting.
