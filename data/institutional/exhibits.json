A moving cell crawls by extending a pseudopod , or fake foot, to grab on to its surroundings, then it pulls its rear end forward.  Meet the Scientists  To create this exhibit, the Exploratorium worked with scientists who study how white blood cells crawl through the human body, patrolling for infections. Using a microscope that captures 3-D images, cell biologist Lillian Fritz-Laylin recorded video of real human cells moving. Then, visualization scientist Megan Riel-Mehan processed the raw data into clearer, more useful images. The 3D-printed cells in this exhibit were based on that movie.  Learn more about the research from cell biologists Lillian Fritz-Laylin from University of Massachusetts, and Dyche Mullins from University of California, San Francisco.

From there, they radiate outward, reflecting off the edges of the square, then overlapping to create patterns of stillness and vibration. Sand bounces off the strongly vibrating places and collects in the still places, leaving a visual record of the vibrations in the square. Different notes vibrate the square at different rates; some special notes are resonant , meaning they vibrate the square at one of its preferred or natural frequencies , leading to extra strong vibrations and a clear and definite pattern on the square.  Chladni patterns make surface vibrations visible: Neighboring clear zones are moving in opposite directions, and sand collects in areas where the surface is still. (click image to enlarge)  Physicist-musician Ernst Chladni came up with the idea to use sand to reveal the pattern of vibrations on a surface in 1787. Today, some makers of violins, cellos, and similar musical instruments still use Chladni patterns to help them craft the belly and back of each instrument, the shapes of which are crucial to the instrument\u2019s unique voice. The mathematics underlying Chladni patterns also helped shed light on the quantum mechanical understanding of electron orbital patterns.

After the initial currents of rising air have carved channels in the powder, subsequent streams follow the paths of least resistance, further deepening and elaborating the drainage network.",

You can also explain the ball\u2019s behavior in terms of Bernoulli\u2019s principle : When the speed of a fluid increases, the pressure in that fluid decreases. As you pull the ball out of the air stream, air flows faster over only one side of the ball. The difference in pressure between the still air and the moving air pushes the ball back into the center of the air stream. Airplanes, too, fly by deflecting air. A flat wing tipped into the wind forces air downward. The reaction to the downward force of the wing on the air is the upward force of the air on the wing. You can feel this lifting force if you hold your hand out the window of a moving car and tip your hand so that it forces the air downward. A wing that\u2019s curved on top will fly even if it isn\u2019t tipped, thanks to what\u2019s called the Coand \u0103 effect , the tendency of a fluid stream to adhere to a surface it passes over.  Air passing over the curved wing top \u201csticks\u201d and follows the arc of the wing, ultimately getting deflected downward. This downward deflection of air produces an upward force on the wing. The Coand\u0103 effect also makes possible the curve balls of baseball and the banana kicks of soccer. Airplanes, too, fly by deflecting air. A flat wing tipped into the wind forces air downward.

Twenty-four of the cards deal with the landscape that is visible from the Fisher Bay Observatory\u2019s windows and the other twenty-four describe places and phenomena along the shoreline between Fort Point and Hunters Point. Every card is an invitation to look closely at the landscape and to wonder about its meanings. The cards\u2019 display cart serves as an orientation device.

The ultimate low-maintenance exhibit, it can live and thrive indefinitely, requiring only sunlight and the occasional addition of water. The different colors you see here come from different types of bacteria: Blue-green cyanobacteria absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and produce oxygen in much the same way that plants do. The orange-colored bacteria are iron oxidizers; they get their energy from the chemical decomposition of iron into rust. The grayish bacteria get their energy not from light, but by consuming cellulose, or plant fibers. This exhibit is a giant version of a Winogradsky column , named after Ukrainian biologist Sergei Winogradsky. You can make your own by putting pond mud, newspaper, eggs, and water in a blender.  CYANOBACTERIA Like plants, cyanobacteria absorb carbon dioxide (C0 2 ) and produce oxygen. Unlike plants, they absorb light with a blue-green pigment, called phycocyanin.

To the observer, the mirror image of the visible half of your body looks exactly like the real half that is obscured behind the mirror. You look whole because the human body is symmetrical. The observer\u2019s brain is tricked into believing that an image of your right side is really your left side. So just straddle the mirror, raise one leg, and you\u2019re flying. You can try this out anywhere where there\u2019s a good-sized mirror that you can straddle or stand alongside\u2014at home, in a department store, or in a dance studio with a doorway cut into a mirrored wall.  \"Reflections on Anti-Gravity Mirror \" (pdf) by artist Bob Miller   The illusion of flight you see at this exhibit was used to create a low-tech, precomputer graphics special effect in the original Star Wars movie.

And boy, are we glad, because this is probably our single most popular exhibit. Is it narcissism\u2014or love of optics? This mirror\u2019s concave spherical shape focuses incoming light to a point\u2014called the focal point \u2014about 1.5 meters (5 feet) from its surface.

Walk slowly toward the mirror from beyond the focal point and you\u2019ll see your own head seem to explode just as you pass through it.

The main difference is its spectacular size\u2014and a near-perfect smoothness that makes for exceptional clarity. Can you come up with any new tricks? Let us know.

    "location": "Gallery 1",
    "details": "Many people expect that a heavier wheel will naturally roll downhill faster than a lighter one. But when an object rolls downhill, its speed depends not on the weight of the wheel, but on where the weight is located. When weight is located far from the center of the wheel, the wheel is harder to get rolling. (A physicist would say it has more rotational inertia .) So even though they may weigh the same, a metal disk will accelerate down a hill faster than a metal hoop, because the hoop\u2019s weight is farther from the center of rotation. Likewise, sliding the adjustable brass weights on the wheels of this exhibit inward decreases their rotational inertia, allowing them to roll downhill faster. Serious skateboarders choose the size of their wheels with rotational inertia in mind. Smaller wheels are easier to get spinning, and also make for a more maneuverable skateboard, which is why they\u2019re the preferred choice of most street skaters.

The concept was developed by Peter Richards and was installed in collaboration with sculptor and master stone mason George Gonzalez. Inspiration for the piece came from artist Bill Fontana\u2019s recordings made of sounds emanating from a vent pipe of a floating concrete dock in Sydney, Australia. In 1980, Richards (a Senior Artist at the Exploratorium for many years) received a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Arts that enabled him to conduct an extensive period of investigation into the physicality of the Wave Organ phenomenon. A prototype, built at the same location, was presented as part of the New Music \u201981 Festival. Though very rudimentary in nature, it generated enthusiasm and support for a permanent work. Permit acquisition and fundraising efforts by Frank Oppenheimer, Founding Director of the Exploratorium, began soon after, but actual construction did not start until September 1985, seven months after Oppenheimer\u2019s death. The Wave Organ was completed in May 1986 and was dedicated in June to the memory of Frank Oppenheimer. The jetty itself was constructed with material taken from a demolished cemetery, providing a wonderful assortment of carved granite and marble, which was used in the construction of this piece. The installation includes 25 organ pipes made of PVC and concrete located at various elevations within the site, allowing for the rise and fall of the tides. Sound is created by the impact of waves against the pipe ends and the subsequent movement of the water in and out of the pipes. The sound heard at the site is subtle, requiring visitors to become sensitized to its music, and at the same time to the music of the environment. The Wave Organ sounds best at high tide.

    "location": "Crossroads",
    "details": "This camera is sensitive to infrared light , an invisible form of energy given off by objects and people alike. Warmer objects radiate more infrared light than cooler objects do, and appear brighter on the projected image. The aluminum table in front of the bench at this exhibit is a good thermal conductor: heat moves through it quickly. When you touch a shape, heat flows easily from your hand to the metal, cooling your skin and creating a dark pattern. As your skin warms, the pattern fades. The various panels behind the bench at this exhibit reflect some forms of energy better than others. Acrylic reflects visible light but not infrared radiation, so your reflection doesn\u2019t show up on the screen. The unpolished copper reflects visible light poorly, so you can\u2019t see yourself in it. But copper does reflect infrared rays\u2014which is why you can see reflected images in the copper panel when you look at it on the screen. Infrared cameras are used in some night vision systems, in industry, astronomy, and to help find heat leaks in insulated homes. Like the camera in this exhibit, rattlesnakes can \u201csee\u201d infrared light\u2014but not with their eyes. Instead, they use infrared-sensing organs called pits, found between the nostril and eye. Being able to sense infrared light helps rattlesnakes and other pit vipers track their warm-blooded prey.

For example, the spring is an image of a spring created by a curved mirror. When you touch the mirror, your finger seems to go into the spring, but it's just an illusion. The exhibit also contains a teapot that appears to be made out of metal, but is actually made out of plastic. The reflections from the mirrors make it look like the teapot is metal.",

Studies on reaction time confirm another thing you might already suspect: Age matters. You are at your speediest in your mid-twenties. After that, it\u2019s a gentle downhill slide, reaction time\u2013wise, until about age seventy, when the downhill slide steepens. But take heart, oldsters: A slower reaction time doesn\u2019t necessarily mean slower overall performance.

    "details": "Identical twins are born with identical DNA, and raised in mostly identical environments. Yet they don\u2019t turn out exactly the same. From birth, and increasingly as they get older, twins show their individuality\u2014both physically and in how they behave. That\u2019s because genetic sequences are just one of many factors that make us who we are. For decades, scientists have studied identical twins, trying to tease apart the relative importance of genes and environment\u2014nature and nurture. They\u2019ve found that genes influence a wide range of human traits, from talent and personality to disease risk. But genes never tell the whole story. Throughout our lives, genes and environment move together like partners in a dance that shapes our lives.   Ila and Sabine Minn-Murray  Age: 3 Live in: Berkeley At first, even their brothers and grandmother couldn\u2019t tell them apart. (Twins tend to be most similar at birth.) But they\u2019re not the same. Sabine, born first, has always been a bit bigger; and she\u2019s left-handed, while Ila is right-handed. And their mother says their voices are quite distinct.   Allison and Amanda Chan  Age: 16 Live in: San Francisco Their parents and close friends can easily tell them apart, but others get confused. They\u2019re almost always together, which might be why they tend to finish each other\u2019s sentences. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been separated for more than a day,\u201d Amanda says. They agree that Amanda is more studious and more of a rule-follower, while Allison (older by one minute) is more outgoing, and more mischievous.   John and William Grady  Age: 30 Live in: Berkeley and San Francisco William became the Exploratorium\u2019s Manager of Custodial Services soon after John left that same job. Some museum staff didn\u2019t realize he was a different person. But compare them closely, and you\u2019ll find that William\u2019s a bit taller and heavier than John. John is married, while William is still single. And John is more outgoing.   Brian and Anthony Pancharoen  Age: 41 Live in: Vallejo and Benicia The children of Thai immigrants, Anthony and Brian are both firefighters for the San Francisco Fire Department (Anthony started six months before Brian). Growing up, their parents dressed them in different colors (Anthony, red; Brian, blue). Anthony\u2019s half an inch taller, more outgoing, and loves to cook. Brian is quieter and more artistic. Anthony\u2019s divorced, while Brian\u2019s engaged.   Andrea and Amy Barish  Age: 58 Live in: Marin County and Oakland Amy and Andrea weren\u2019t certain that they were identical twins until they got a genetic test at age 40. And while acquaintances sometimes mix them up, they\u2019re less alike than most twins. Andrea\u2019s an inch and a half taller. She\u2019s also had breast cancer, while her sister hasn\u2019t. Andrea\u2019s more adventuresome, and Amy\u2019s more mechanically inclined.   Hannah Nunn and Helen Colcord  Age: 81 Live in: Napa and Portola Valley All but inseparable as girls, Helen and Hannah wore matching clothes, answered to each other\u2019s names, and sometimes even went on dates for each other. Then in high school their parents sent them to separate boarding schools where they began developing their own identities. Hannah studied ballet at the University of Utah, married, and moved to California, while Helen studied art at Bennington College, and moved to New York City to work in design. (They both later worked in interior design.) After some 50 years on opposite coasts, Helen recently rejoined Hannah in they Bay Area. \u201cBut I still feel like an east coast person,\u201d she says.",

About the Plant Scents   Citrus Leaves Citrus leaves smell like citrus fruit, mixed with grass. The same oils that give fruit like oranges, lemons, and limes their bright scent are also found in the leaves.  Rose Petals Rose petals have a sweet, heavy smell. Many cultures make tea from rose hips or use the petals for perfume. In Ohlone stories, the rose plant is a beloved character, who heals the sick.  Fatwood Fatwood, called \u201cocote\u201d in Mexico, is wood from the heart of an old pine tree. The wood is rich in sap and resin, which makes it a good for starting fires and gives it a distinctive smell.  Juniper Berries Juniper berries are a key ingredient in gin. You might recognize their piney scent from a fancy cocktail.  Mint Mint is popular in many cuisines, and there are hundreds of varieties. In the Bay Area, you can find a wild mint called yerba buena growing in forested areas.  Beet Greens and Potato Skins Beet greens and potato skins contain a chemical called geosmin, which smells like soil after a rain.  Bay Laurel, or sok\u00f3ote \u201csok\u00f3ote is an important plant for Ohlone people. We gather all parts of this respected plant: its leaves are used for ceremonial, culinary, and medicinal purposes; its fruit and nuts are eaten as a fine delicacy; its wood is made into beautiful cultural objects such as stick dice, a traditional Ohlone game; sok\u00f3ote boughs are wrapped into wreaths worn around the head, interspersed with springtime flowers. Its smell is beloved by Ohlone people as sok\u00f3ote is intensely aromatic\u2014both sweet and peppery at the same time.\u201d \u2014Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino, East Bay Ohlone and Rumsen cultural leaders",

Out of the daylight and the scent of trees and that lake where generations of swans no longer move among children. In a poisoned time. But the bright-headed children move. Dark, high, the beams of a huge building exposed in the high dark air. I see brightness with a shock of joy. II Past the darkness a lashing of color. Not color, strands of light. Not light but pure deep color beyond color, like the pure fierce light I once knew, before a minute of blindness. These colors are deeper; the entire range in its millions, twisting and brilliant traveling. III I stand in the strong sun before a bank of prisms. On the screen in front of me, tangled colors of light, twined, intertwined. A sensitive web of light changing, for the sun moved, the air moves The perceiver moves. I dance my slow dance. IV The deepest blue, green, not the streams of the sea, the clear yellow of yellows, not California, more, not Mediterranean, not the Judean steeps. Red beyond blood over flame, more even than visionary America.  All light, A man braced on the sun, where the sun enters through the roof, where the sun-follower, A man-made motor with a gentle motion just counters the movement of the earth, holds this scene in front of us on the man-made screen. Light traveling, meets, leaps and becomes art. V Colors move on a screen. The doors open again. They run in, the California children. They run past the colors and the colors change. The laughter of running. They cry out, bird-voices, ninety seven children,Wow! Wow! Howcome? VI Another day. I stand before the screen, Alone I move, selecting out my green, choose out the red with my arm, I let the orange stand, a web of yellow, the blue stays and shines. I am part of the color, I am part of the sun. VII You have made an art in which the sun is standing. It changes, goes dark, goes grey. The sun appears. You have led me through eleven states of being. You have invited us all. Allow the sunlight, dance your dance. VIII Another day. No sun. the fog is down, doing its slow dance into the city, it enters the Gate and my waking.

I am part of the color, I am part of the sun. VII You have made an art in which the sun is standing. It changes, goes dark, goes grey. The sun appears. You have led me through eleven states of being.

    "description": "Soap film hits the big time at this exhibit, featuring a giant square soap bubble the size of a picture window. The cascading colors you see here arise from overlapping light waves that reflect from the front and back surfaces of the soap film\u2014a phenomenon called interference . ",
    "location": "Gallery 3",
    "details": "This five-foot-square soap film, created by pulling a cord, is a soapy-water sandwich, with two outside layers of soap molecules around an inner layer of soapy water. The thickness of the soap film changes as the water drains down the inside of the film. When white light (made up of many colors) shines on the soap film, some of the light is reflected and the rest is transmitted through to the rear surface. At the rear surface of the soap film, more of the light is reflected back to your eyes. The light reflecting from the front of the film meets up with the light reflecting from the back of the film, and the waves overlap. It\u2019s this overlapping of the light waves that creates the beautiful interference colors you see on the soap film. Interference colors are created as two reflected waves overlap and line up either in phase or out of phase. If two waves line up in phase\u2014that is, with crests together and troughs together\u2014we say that the waves are interfering constructively. When two waves line up out of phase, crest to trough, we say that the waves are interfering destructively.   Constructive interference  Destructive interference White light can be considered a mixture of three additive primary colors: red, green, and blue. If the thickness of the soap film is just right to cause the destructive interference of one of these additive primaries, you perceive a mixture of the two remaining colors:  white \u2013 red = blue + green = cyan (bluish green)   white \u2013 green = red + blue = magenta (reddish blue)   white \u2013 blue = red + green = yellow  In other words, everywhere you see yellow, the film is just the right thickness to destructively interfere with the blue light waves, removing them. Where you see cyan, the red light has been removed. And where you see magenta, the green light has been removed. When all the colors disappear, watch out: the soap film has gotten so thin that it\u2019s about to pop.  You can find interference colors in all sorts of places\u2014including butterfly wings, opal, oil slicks, and peacock feathers. (click image to enlarge)  If you wet your hand in the soapy water, you may be able to put your fingers through the film. You can also use a plastic ring to put a porthole in the bubble wall. The surface tension that allows a soap film to form is caused by the tendency of water to minimize its surface area. Soap reduces surface tension by separating water molecules from each other. When a finger, pencil, or piece of PVC pipe is coated with bubble solution and inserted into the soap film, the film stays in contact with the object without disruption. But a dry finger interrupts the continuity of the reduced surface tension \u201cmembrane,\u201d causing the bubble to burst.

Although zebrafish don\u2019t look much like humans, our embryos follow a similar path during early development, so we can study zebrafish to learn about human development. For example, there are genetic mutations in zebrafish that cause heart defects that are very similar to mutations that cause defects in human hearts.

The independent \u201csmart\u201d platforms communicate with each other over a robust wireless network.  Through the use of recycled ocean plastic, Lewin aims to impact the recovery of our oceans and planet and to explore the crisis of polluted oceans, a warming planet, dwindling natural resources, and an urgent need for systemic change. She also asks us to consider how a global community can connect, address, and mitigate the issues our planet faces.  In 2021 the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica experienced a significant calving event \u2014the breaking away of a mass of ice. The detached piece of ice was named Iceberg A-74.

Block the red light and the blue and green light mix to create cyan; block the green light and the red and blue light make magenta; block the blue light and red and green make yellow. If you block all three lights, you get a black shadow. It may seem strange that a red light and a green light mix to make yellow light on a white screen. It just so happens that a particular mixture of red and green light stimulates the cones in your eyes exactly as much as they\u2019re stimulated by yellow light\u2014that is, by light from the yellow portion of the rainbow\u2014so your eye can't tell the difference.

    "location": "Crossroads",
    "details": "Invented in 1911, cloud chambers like this one were among the first devices used to study high-energy particles called cosmic rays , believed to come from exploding stars called supernovas . As cosmic rays travel through the air, they collide with air molecules and break them up into charged fragments called ions . Meanwhile, inside the cloud chamber, a tray of alcohol is heated to form alcohol vapor. The alcohol vapor in the cloud chamber condenses around the trail of ions created by a cosmic ray, a trail you see as a visible streak of tiny droplets. Most of the tracks you see\u2014roughly 4 out of 5\u2014are made by unstable elementary particles called muon s. Muons have a negative charge like electrons, but they are 207 times heavier. The rest of the tracks are electrons; these tracks are shorter and curlier than muon tracks. Occasional heavier tracks are made by protons or by natural radioactivity in the air or in the exhibit itself. Today, cloud chambers have been replaced by tracking chambers and scintillators , which track particle paths by producing an electric signal, rather than a visible trail.
