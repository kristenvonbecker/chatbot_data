62898,reciprocity,[],[],0,"  reciprocity , in international trade, the granting of mutual concessions in tariff rates, quotas, or other commercial restrictions. Reciprocity implies that these concessions are neither intended nor expected to be generalized to other countries with which the contracting parties have commercial treaties. Reciprocity agreements may be made between individual countries or groups of countries.  The logical extension of reciprocity is the development of a full customs union (e.g., the European Union ) that eliminates by progressive mutual concessions all tariffs and other restrictions between participating countries.  Membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to some extent precludes the establishment of reciprocity treaties, because WTO member countries assume the obligation to grant to all other members most-favoured-nation treatment (extension to member countries of every trade concession made to nonmember countries).

38514,Guna,[],[],0,"  Guna , also spelled Goona , city, northern Madhya Pradesh state, central India . It lies on the Madhya Bharat Plateau , just west of the Sind River.  Guna rose to prominence in the mid-19th century when it became a military station for the Gwalior Cavalry. The presiding Hindu deity of Guna is Hanuman , whose temples are located to the east and west of the city. Jain temples in and around Guna are also of some importance.  Guna became a trading centre after the opening of the Guna-Baran Railway line at the end of the 19th century. It is now situated on a major highway between Agra , Uttar Pradesh state (north), and Mumbai (Bombay), Maharashtra state (southwest), that also connects it to Gwalior , Indore , and other cities in Madhya Pradesh. The main industries are cigarette making and bicycle manufacturing, and cotton ginning, oilseed milling, and hand-loom weaving are important. The city has several colleges affiliated with Jiwaji University in Gwalior. Wheat, sorghum (jowar), legumes, corn (maize), and oilseeds are the major crops grown in the surrounding area. Pop.

62859,Reading,[],[],0,"  Reading: Eng., on the River Kennet © Amanda Lewis/Dreamstime.com Reading , town and unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Berkshire , southern England , 38 miles (61 km) west of London . It is an important junction of railways running west from London and south from the Midlands , and the Kennet and Avon Canal (to Bath and Bristol ) and the River Thames afford it connections by water. It lies on the River Kennet where it joins the Thames.  Reading was a Danish encampment as early as 871. Between the 12th and 16th centuries Reading was dominated by a struggle for privileges between the abbey and the emergent merchants' guild. The town suffered severely in the English Civil Wars of the mid-17th century. By the 17th century the town's trade, notably in clothing, had begun to decline. In the 18th century the chief trade was in malt.  The first town charter is that of Henry III (1253), confirmed and amplified by succeeding sovereigns. The government charter until 1835 was that of Charles I (1639), incorporating the town under the title of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses. The market, held on Saturday, can be traced to the reign of Henry III.  In the public gardens are the ruins of a Benedictine abbey, founded by Henry I in 1121 and once ranking as third in all England; it was dissolved by Henry VIII , who turned it into a palace, but then it was destroyed during the English Civil Wars. A tablet in the chapter house notes that the famous medieval round “Sumer is icumen in” was written by a monk there about 1240. A memorial stone marks the grave of Henry I (died 1135). In Reading Gaol, adjoining the ruins, Oscar Wilde wrote the long letter later revised and published as De Profundis ; the long poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol came later.  Reading is an agricultural centre noted for the bulbs produced in its nursery gardens. Its other best-known industries are biscuit manufacture and malting and brewing, and there is much business in printing, iron foundries, engineering works, and computers. There are pottery and brick works, together with riverside boatbuilding yards. A college affiliated with the University of Oxford was opened in 1892, and it became the independent University of Reading in 1926. Its researches into agriculture, horticulture, and dairying are of special importance. Area 15 square miles (40 square km). Pop. (2001) 143,096; (2011) 155,698. Encyclopædia Britannica"
62860,Reading,[],[],0,"  Reading: Pa. Reading , city, seat (1752) of Berks county , southeastern Pennsylvania , U.S., on the Schuylkill River , 51 miles (82 km) northwest of Philadelphia . Laid out in 1748 by Nicholas Scull and William Parsons on land owned by Thomas and Richard Penn (sons of William Penn , Pennsylvania's founder), it was built around Penn Common, a large open square, and named for the hometown of the Penn family in Berkshire , England. During the American Revolution , Reading served as a supply depot and manufacturer of cannon.  Industrial growth began in the late 18th century with the development of the iron and steel industries in Berks county. After the production of upper Great Lakes ore overshadowed that of Pennsylvania ore, Reading shifted to the fabrication of iron and steel. The opening of the Schuylkill Canal to Philadelphia (1824) and the Union Canal to Lebanon and Middletown on the Susquehanna River (1828) and the completion of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (1884) greatly stimulated industrial growth. In the 1890s, safety-bicycle manufacturing mushroomed. Development of the textile and hosiery industry was started about 1900 by two German technicians, Ferdinand Thun and Henry Janssen, who installed the first braiding and knitting machine in the country. In 1974 Reading became the site of the world's first multi-tenant manufacturers' outlet (opened by women's lingerie manufacturer Vanity Fair), and outlet stores and malls continue to play a prominent role in the local economy. In the early 21st century, local industries included electronic components, batteries, specialty steels, energy-storage technology, and medical devices.  The Reading area is the seat of Albright College (1856), Alvernia University (1958), Kutztown University (originally Keystone State Normal School, 1866), and the Berks campus (1958) of Berks–Lehigh Valley College of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State Berks). Mount Penn (1,300 feet [396 metres]), with a red-and-gold pagoda (1908) and a stone observation tower (1939) at its summit, is the centre of a city park. Local historic landmarks include the Daniel Boone Homestead (where Boone was born in 1734), the Conrad Weiser Homestead (1729), and Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site near Pottstown . An annual folk festival at nearby Kutztown reflects the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) heritage of the area.  Officially designated “Baseballtown” in 2002 by local authorities, the Greater Reading area has a long history with the American national pastime that dates from the formation of the Reading Athletic Club in 1858. Minor league professional baseball has been played on and off in Reading since the late 19th century, and the Reading Fightin Phils of the Eastern League have been an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies since 1967—currently the longest continuous association between a Major League Baseball team and a “farm club.” The city also has a minor league ice hockey team.

3431,Abū Qīr Bay,[],[],0,"  Abū Qīr Bay , also called Abukir Bay , or Aboukir Bay , semicircular inlet of the Mediterranean Sea, lying between Abū Qīr Point (southwest) and the mouth of the Rosetta Branch (northeast) of the Nile River delta, in Lower Egypt. The bay was the scene of the Battle of the Nile (1798), in which an English fleet under Rear Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson defeated the French fleet, thus cutting off communications with France and eventually contributing to the early departure of French troops from Egypt. A natural-gas field, developed offshore in the late 1970s, provides energy for industries around Alexandria. Encyclopædia Britannica"
