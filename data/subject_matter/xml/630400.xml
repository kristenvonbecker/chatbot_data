  opens at the premiere of a movie starring silent-film idol George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin). Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), one of Valentin’s adoring fans, contrives to slip past the security cordon and reach Valentin’s side, where she playfully kisses him. A photograph of the kiss appears in the next day’s newspaper, captioned “Who’s That Girl?” She auditions as a dancer, and, when Valentin sees her at Kinograph Studios, he insists to the studio boss, Al Zimmer (

  . Over the next few years, Peppy establishes her career. One day, Zimmer shows Valentin an innovation: film with sound. Valentin dismisses the idea. Talkies take hold nonetheless, and Peppy becomes a star of the new era. Eventually, Zimmer fires Valentin.

  , and his movie fails at the box office. Valentin begins drinking heavily; his wife, Doris (Penelope Ann Miller), leaves him; and he is forced to move from his mansion to a tiny apartment. Eventually, he begins auctioning off his belongings and must let his loyal chauffeur, Clifton (James Cromwell), go. One night, in alcohol-fueled despair, he attempts to burn all his old film reels. The conflagration engulfs his apartment, and his constant companion, a Jack Russell terrier, rushes out to find a nearby policeman to save Valentin. He is found unconscious, clutching a film canister. Peppy sees the news of his hospitalization and rushes to his bedside. When she sees that the film that he saved is

  , she takes him to her mansion to recuperate. He discovers that Clifton is now working for Peppy and that it was Peppy who bought the personal items that he sold. Upset, he rips off his bandages and returns to his charred apartment. Peppy returns from the studio and finds Valentin gone. She gets in her car and frantically drives to his home, arriving just in time to stop him from shooting himself. She tells him that he has a part in her next movie. In the final scene, which has sound, Peppy and Valentin are tap-dancing together while making a musical.
