  Pigments for green come from malachite, cobalt oxide, zinc oxide, copper acetate, and artificial chemical compounds. In the 19th century, green pigment made with copper arsenite was known for its toxicity, and some supporters of

  In addition to the colour wheel, various other colour systems have been used to classify green. Before the invention of colour photography,
  <e type="italic">
   Werner’s Nomenclature of Colour
  </e>
  (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint “Duck Green” is compared to the “Neck of Mallard,” the “Upper Disk of Yew Leaves,” and “Ceylanite.” In the

  —adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry—one of the many variations of green is identified as 2.5G 5/24.
