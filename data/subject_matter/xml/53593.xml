  , in logic, the classification of categorical syllogisms according to the quantity (universal or particular) and quality (affirmative or negative) of their constituent propositions. There are four forms of propositions:
  <e type="italic">
   A
  </e>
  (universal affirmative),
  <e type="italic">
   E
  </e>
  (universal negative),
  <e type="italic">
   I
  </e>
  (particular affirmative), and
  <e type="italic">
   O
  </e>
  (particular negative). Because each syllogism has three propositions and each proposition may take four different forms, there are 64 different patterns (moods) of syllogisms. Twenty-four of the 64 possible moods are valid, though only 19 were traditionally accepted as valid. Various mnemonic terms are employed to label these moods. The vowels of these terms represent the forms of propositions in the syllogism. For example, “Felapton” is the mnemonic term to signify the mood in which the major premise (the premise containing the predicate of the conclusion) of the syllogism is an
  <e type="italic">
   E
  </e>
  proposition, the minor premise (the premise containing the subject of the conclusion) is an
  <e type="italic">
   A
  </e>
  , and the conclusion is an
  <e type="italic">
   O
  </e>
