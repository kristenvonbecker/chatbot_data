  During the Archaic period, Greek art became less rigidly stylized and more naturalistic. Paintings on vases evolved from geometric designs to representations of human figures, often illustrating epic tales. In sculpture, faces were animated with the characteristic “Archaic smile,” and bodies were rendered with a growing attention to human proportion and anatomy. The development of the Doric and Ionic orders of architecture in the Archaic period also reflected a growing concern with harmonious architectural proportions.
