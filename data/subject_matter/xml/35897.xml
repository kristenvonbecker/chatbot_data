  , in architecture, any covered passage that is open at one side, such as a portico or a colonnade. More specifically, in late medieval and Renaissance Italian architecture, it is a narrow balcony or platform running the length of a wall. In Romanesque architecture, especially in Italy and Germany, an arcaded wall-passage on the outside of a structure is known as a dwarf gallery.

  Facing into a structure, a gallery may either be set into the thickness of a wall at ground level or be elevated and supported on columns or corbels. It would function as a communicating passage. Within an interior space a gallery may be a platform projecting from a wall, as in the example of a musicians’ gallery, or may be a second-story opening onto a large interior area, such as the gallery in a church intended to provide additional seating. In legislative houses such a gallery might be intended for spectators or the press. In theatres the gallery is the highest balcony and generally contains the least expensive seats.

  Galleries appear as long, narrow rooms in substantial Renaissance houses and palaces, where they were used as promenades and to exhibit art. In Elizabethan and Jacobean houses these were called long galleries. The modern term art gallery is derived from this usage.
