   tree-ring dating
  </e>
  , the scientific discipline concerned with dating and interpreting past events, particularly paleoclimates and climatic trends, based on the analysis of tree rings. Samples are obtained by means of an increment borer, a simple metal tube of small diameter that can be driven into a tree to get a core extending from bark to centre. This core is split in the laboratory, the rings are counted and measured, and the sequence of rings is correlated with sequences from other cores.

  Dendrochronology is based on the fact that many species of trees produce growth rings during annual growing seasons. The width of the ring (

  the amount of growth) for each year is determined by various internal and external factors, but it tends to vary mainly in proportion to either the amount of available precipitation or the prevailing temperatures. The ring measurements taken from trees with overlapping ages can extend knowledge of climates back thousands of years. The bristlecone pines of California have proven to be particularly suitable for such chronologies, since some individual trees are more than 4,000 years old.
