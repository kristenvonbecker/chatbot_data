  , pressed glassware produced in sets of many pieces decorated with the same pattern. Manufactured in large quantities in the United States in 1840–80 by the larger glassworks, it was an offshoot of the American invention (1820s) of mechanically pressed glass, which allowed cheaper production. Pattern sets sometimes included a staggering number of pieces, ranging from sugar bowls to celery vases. More than 250 major patterns are known to have been made. Some popular patterns, known as camphor glass, combined the use of clear glass with an acid-finished design.
