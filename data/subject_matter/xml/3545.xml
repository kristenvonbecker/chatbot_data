  The mechanism of acid- and base-catalyzed reactions is explained in terms of the Brønsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases as one in which there is an initial transfer of
  <xref articleid="61626">
   protons
  </xref>
  from an acidic catalyst to the reactant or from the reactant to a basic catalyst. In terms of the Lewis theory of acids and bases, the reaction entails sharing of an

  </xref>
  pair donated by a base catalyst or accepted by an acid catalyst.

    Catalytic cracking is a refinery process designed to produce more valuable gasoline out of less valuable heavy hydrocarbon cuts. Straight-run heavy gas oil and flasher tops along with a catalyst are pumped into a high-temperature moderate-pressure reaction chamber, where the conversion occurs. In the reaction chamber, coke (carbon) coats the catalyst and it becomes ineffective (spent). To remove the coke, the spent catalyst is put into a regenerator with hot air. The cracked cuts from the reaction chamber are pumped into a fractionator, where they are separated into cat-cracked gasoline, cat-cracked light gas oil, and cat-cracked heavy gas oil. Natural gas comes out of the top of the fractionator, and fractionator bottoms, or cycle oil, comes out the bottom. The cycle oil is run through the cat-cracking process again.

  Acid catalysis is employed in a large number of industrial reactions, among them the conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to

  and related products. Such reactions include decomposition of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (cracking) using

  Among industrial applications of base-catalyzed reactions is the reaction of diisocyanates with polyfunctional alcohols in the presence of amines, used in the manufacture of
