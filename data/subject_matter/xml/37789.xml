   graveyard school
  </e>
  , genre of 18th-century British poetry that focused on death and bereavement. The graveyard school consisted largely of imitations of Robert Blair’s popular long poem of morbid appeal,

   The Grave
  </e>
  (1743), and of Edward Young’s celebrated blank-verse dramatic rhapsody
  <e type="italic">
   Night Thoughts
  </e>
  (1742–45). These poems express the sorrow and pain of bereavement, evoke the horror of death’s physical manifestations, and suggest the transitory nature of human life. The meditative, philosophical tendencies of graveyard poetry found their fullest expression in Thomas Gray’s “An Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard” (1751). The poem is a dignified, gently melancholy elegy celebrating the graves of humble and unknown villagers and suggesting that the lives of rich and poor alike “lead but to the grave.” The works of the graveyard school were significant as early precursors of the Romantic Movement.
