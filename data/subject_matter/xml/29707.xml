   declaratory judgment
  </e>
  , in law, a judicial judgment intended to fix or elucidate litigants’ rights that were previously uncertain or doubtful. A declaratory judgment is binding but is distinguished from other judgments or court opinions in that it lacks an executory process. It simply declares or defines rights to be observed or wrongs to be eschewed by a plaintiff, a defendant, or both, or expresses the court’s determination of a contested question of law, without ordering that anything be done. Although a declaratory judgment must deal with a real as opposed to a hypothetical dispute, it is not necessary for an actual wrong, giving rise either to criminal liability or to a claim for civil damages, to have been done or even threatened or contemplated. The Declaratory Judgment Act established its use in U.S. law in 1934.
