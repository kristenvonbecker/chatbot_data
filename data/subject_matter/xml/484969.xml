  , published in 1953. It was Baldwin’s first novel and is considered his finest. Based on the author’s experiences as a teenaged preacher in a small revivalist church, the novel describes two days and a long night in the life of the Grimes family, particularly 14-year-old John and his stepfather, Gabriel. It is a classic of contemporary African American literature.

  Baldwin’s description of John’s descent into the depths of his young soul was hailed as brilliant, as was his exploration of Gabriel’s complex sorrows. The novel teems with biblical references. Though the novel is in part about the position of blacks in American society, some critics felt that Baldwin did not adequately address racial issues; the novelist, however, said he made a deliberate attempt to break out of the “cage” of black writing.
