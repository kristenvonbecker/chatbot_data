  , and

  , can be examined in this way, because the high field at the tip exerts a large mechanical stress. The magnification is proportional to the ratio of the radius of curvature of the screen on which the image forms to the radius of the metal tip; it may reach up to 1,000,000×.

  A development of the field-emission microscope is the field-ion microscope, in which the tip is surrounded by a low pressure of
  <xref articleid="1713">
   helium
  </xref>
  gas. The gas is ionized at the
  <xref articleid="110411">
   atom
  </xref>
  planes on the tip and produces an image that can have a magnification of up to 10,000,000×. The field-ion microscope has been applied mainly to the study of metals and
  <xref articleid="66711">

  , but a few biological images have been obtained. A further development of the field-ion microscope is the atom probe. In this instrument, individual atoms are removed from the tip by pulsing the electric field. The atoms pass through a time-of-flight spectrometer, which measures their energy and charge-to-mass ratio. In this way the chemical nature of each atom in the field-ion image may be determined.
