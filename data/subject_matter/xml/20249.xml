  Carbon dioxide was recognized as a gas different from others early in the 17th century by a Belgian chemist,
  <xref articleid="39924">
   Jan Baptista van Helmont
  </xref>
  , who observed it as a product of both fermentation and combustion. It liquefies upon compression to 75 kg per square centimetre (1,071 pounds per square inch) at 31 °C (87.4 °F) or to 16–24 kg per sq cm (230–345 lb per sq in.) at −23 to −12 °C (−10 to 10 °F). By the mid-20th century, most carbon dioxide was sold as the liquid. If the liquid is allowed to expand to atmospheric pressure, it cools and partially freezes to a snowlike solid called
  <xref articleid="31275">
   dry ice
  </xref>
  that
  <xref articleid="70098">
   sublimes
  </xref>
  (passes directly into vapour without melting) at −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F) at the pressure of the normal atmosphere.

  At ordinary temperatures, carbon dioxide is quite unreactive; above 1,700 °C (3,100 °F) it partially decomposes into
  <xref articleid="20252">
   carbon monoxide
  </xref>
  and
  <xref articleid="57841">
   oxygen
  </xref>
  . Hydrogen or carbon also convert it to carbon monoxide at high temperatures. Ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide under pressure to form ammonium carbamate, then

  <xref articleid="34126">

  . Carbon dioxide is slightly soluble in
  <xref articleid="76210">

  (1.79 volumes per volume at 0 °C and atmospheric pressure, larger amounts at higher pressures), forming a weakly acidic
