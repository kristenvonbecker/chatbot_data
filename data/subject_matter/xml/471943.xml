  and later worked as an animator at Disney Productions. After making a series of short films, including the horror-movie homage
  <e type="italic">

  (1984), Burton directed his first feature film,
  <e type="italic">
   Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure
  </e>
  , in 1985. A box-office success, the family movie centred on a man-child (played by Paul Reubens) looking for his stolen bicycle. With the dark comedy

  <e type="italic">

  (1992). Both films were major hits. Burton was also responsible for the concept and general design of the stop-motion animation film
  <e type="italic">
