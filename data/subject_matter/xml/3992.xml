  in the United States. It was present in the
  <xref articleid="117455">
   Pleistocene Epoch
  </xref>
  (approximately 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) during the last two phases of the Wisconsin glacial age, when the
  <xref articleid="47362">
   Laurentide Ice Sheet
  </xref>
  blocked the drainage of the northern
  <xref articleid="110719">
   Great Plains
  </xref>
  into what is today
  <xref articleid="41392">
   Hudson Bay
  </xref>
  . As a result, the waters of the
  <xref articleid="65829">
   Saskatchewan
  </xref>
  and other rivers backed up, forming the 1,100-km (700-mile)-long by 300-km (200-mile)-wide Lake Agassiz and the smaller lakes of Souris and Saskatchewan, which drained through various outlets (depending upon their water level) either into the
  <xref articleid="110729">
   Mississippi River
  </xref>
  (via the Minnesota River) or
  <xref articleid="70396">
   Lake Superior
  </xref>
  . With the retreat of the ice sheet after nearly 1,000 years, a channel to the north (now the
  <xref articleid="55223">
   Nelson River
  </xref>
  ) drained the 285,000-sq-km (110,000-sq-mile) Lake Agassiz into Hudson Bay, leaving Lakes

  as remnants. The fine claylike silt that accumulated on the bottom of Agassiz is responsible for the fertility of the valleys of the
  <xref articleid="62952">

  and
