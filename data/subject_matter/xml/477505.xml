  documents the disintegration of the marriage of a middle-aged, upper-middle-class couple. After an argument, Richard (played by John Marley) and Maria (Lynn Carlin) both have one-night stands, further straining their relationship. Actress Gena Rowlands, Cassavetes’s wife, portrayed the prostitute who sleeps with Richard.

  offers little hope for happiness, and the incessant, uncomfortable close-up shots of the characters only heighten the suffocating intensity of the plot. Although a consummate actor, Cassavetes was primarily devoted to directing and screenwriting. He used his income as an actor to finance bold, experimental films, many of which were of such limited commercial appeal that major studios would not back them.
