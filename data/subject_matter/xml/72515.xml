  equipment (e.g., video display terminals and printers), it has sufficient time to solve several discrete problems during the input/output process. Even though the CPU addresses the problem of each user in sequence, access to and retrieval from the time-sharing system seems instantaneous from the standpoint of remote terminals since the solutions are available to them the moment the problem is completely entered.

  Time-sharing was developed during the late 1950s and early ’60s to make more efficient use of expensive processor time. Commonly used time-sharing techniques include multiprocessing, parallel operation, and multiprogramming. Also, many
