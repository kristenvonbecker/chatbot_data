   Its great advances notwithstanding, astronomy is still subject to a major constraint: it is inherently an observational rather than an experimental science. Almost all measurements must be performed at great distances from the objects of interest, with no control over such quantities as their

   ,
   <xref articleid="61303">

In the future, space missions may return surface materials from Mars, or other objects, but much of astronomy appears otherwise confined to Earth-based observations augmented by observations from orbiting satellites and long-range space probes and supplemented by theory.

    A central undertaking in astronomy is the determination of distances. Without a knowledge of astronomical distances, the size of an observed object in space would remain nothing more than an angular diameter and the brightness of a
    <xref articleid="110472">
     star
    </xref>
    could not be converted into its true radiated power, or
    <xref articleid="476614">
     luminosity
    </xref>
    . Astronomical distance measurement began with a knowledge of
    <xref articleid="110147">
     Earth’s
    </xref>
    diameter, which provided a base for triangulation. Within the inner
    <xref articleid="110143">
     solar system
    </xref>
    , some distances can now be better determined through the timing of
    <xref articleid="109463">
     radar
    </xref>
    reflections or, in the case of the
    <xref articleid="110148">
     Moon
    </xref>
    , through
    <xref articleid="47248">
     laser
    </xref>
    ranging. For the outer planets, triangulation is still used. Beyond the solar system, distances to the closest stars are determined through triangulation, in which the diameter of Earth’s
    <xref articleid="57286">
     orbit
    </xref>
    serves as the baseline and shifts in stellar
    <xref articleid="58395">
     parallax
    </xref>
    are the measured quantities. Stellar distances are commonly expressed by astronomers in
    <xref articleid="58565">
     parsecs
    </xref>
    (pc), kiloparsecs, or megaparsecs. (1 pc = 3.086 × 10

    </sup>
    cm, or about 3.26 light-years [1.92 × 10
    <sup>

    miles].) Distances can be measured out to around a kiloparsec by trigonometric parallax (

    </e>
    <xref articleid="110472" refid="h52809">
     star: Determining stellar distances
    </xref>
    ). The accuracy of measurements made from Earth’s surface is limited by
    <xref articleid="126202">
     atmospheric
    </xref>
    effects, but measurements made from the
    <xref articleid="387679">
     Hipparcos
    </xref>
    satellite in the 1990s extended the scale to stars as far as 650 parsecs, with an accuracy of about a thousandth of an arc second. The
    <xref articleid="476661">
     Gaia
    </xref>
    satellite is expected to measure stars as far away as 10 kiloparsecs to an accuracy of 20 percent. Less-direct measurements must be used for more-distant stars and for
    <xref articleid="110642">
     galaxies
    </xref>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Two general methods for determining galactic distances are described here. In the first, a clearly identifiable type of star is used as a reference standard because its luminosity has been well determined. This requires observation of such stars that are close enough to Earth that their distances and luminosities have been reliably measured. Such a star is termed a “standard candle.” Examples are
    <xref articleid="22121">
     Cepheid variables
    </xref>
    , whose brightness varies periodically in well-documented ways, and certain types of
    <xref articleid="70402">
     supernova
    </xref>
    explosions that have enormous brilliance and can thus be seen out to very great distances. Once the luminosities of such nearer standard candles have been calibrated, the distance to a farther standard candle can be calculated from its calibrated luminosity and its actual measured intensity. (The measured intensity [
    <e type="italic">
     I
    </e>
    ] is related to the luminosity [
    <e type="italic">
     L
    </e>
    ] and distance [
    <e type="italic">
     d
    </e>
    ] by the formula
    <e type="italic">
     I
    </e>
    =
    <e type="italic">
     L
    </e>
    /4π
    <e type="italic">
     d
    </e>
    <sup>
     2
    </sup>
    .) A standard candle can be identified by means of its spectrum or the pattern of regular variations in brightness. (Corrections may have to be made for the absorption of starlight by interstellar gas and dust over great distances.) This method forms the basis of measurements of distances to the closest galaxies.

    The second method for galactic distance measurements makes use of the observation that the distances to galaxies generally correlate with the speeds with which those galaxies are receding from Earth (as determined from the
    <xref articleid="30955">
     Doppler shift
    </xref>
    in the wavelengths of their emitted light). This correlation is expressed in the Hubble law: velocity =

    × distance, in which
    <e type="italic">
     H
    </e>
    denotes
    <xref articleid="41369">
     Hubble’s constant
    </xref>
    , which must be determined from observations of the rate at which the galaxies are receding. There is widespread agreement that
    <e type="italic">
     H

    lies between 67 and 73 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/sec/Mpc).
    <e type="italic">

The astronomical unit was originally defined by observations of the mean radius of Earth’s orbit but is now defined as 149,597,870.7 km (about 93 million miles). Mercury, at 0.4 AU, is the closest planet to the Sun, while Neptune, at 30.1 AU, is the farthest. Pluto’s orbit, with a mean radius of 39.5 AU, is sufficiently eccentric that at times it is closer to the Sun than is Neptune. The planes of the planetary orbits are all within a few degrees of the

    The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and many satellites show extensive cratering, produced by high-speed impacts (

    <xref articleid="32940">
     eroded
    </xref>
    , but remnants of very large craters can be seen in aerial and spacecraft photographs of the terrestrial surface. On Mercury, Mars, and the Moon, the absence of water and any significant atmosphere has left the craters unchanged for billions of years, apart from disturbances produced by infrequent later impacts. Volcanic activity has been an important force in the shaping of the surfaces of the Moon and the terrestrial planets. Seismic activity on the Moon has been monitored by means of seismometers left on its surface by
    <xref articleid="8019">
     Apollo
    </xref>

Cratering on the largest scale seems to have ceased about three billion years ago, although on the Moon there is clear evidence for a continued cosmic drizzle of small particles, with the larger objects churning (“gardening”) the lunar surface and the smallest producing microscopic impact pits in crystals in the lunar rocks.

The results of the analyses have enabled investigators to determine the composition and age of the lunar surface. Seismic observations have made it possible to probe the lunar interior. In addition, retroreflectors left on the Moon’s surface by Apollo astronauts have allowed high-power laser beams to be sent from Earth to the Moon and back, permitting scientists to monitor the Earth-Moon distance to an accuracy of a few centimetres. This experiment, which has provided data used in calculations of the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system, has shown that the separation of the two bodies is increasing by 4.4 cm (1.7 inches) each year.

     Since the 1990s more than a thousand comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been observed with large telescopes; a few are about half the size of Pluto, and Pluto is the largest Kuiper belt object. Pluto’s orbital and physical characteristics had long caused it to be regarded as an anomaly among the planets. However, after the discovery of numerous other Pluto-like objects beyond Neptune, Pluto was seen to be no longer unique in its “neighbourhood” but rather a giant member of the local population. Consequently, in 2006 astronomers at the general assembly of the
     <xref articleid="384469">

     Meteorites are classified into three broad groups: stony (chondrites and achondrites; about 94 percent), iron (5 percent), and stony-iron (1 percent). Most meteoroids that enter the atmosphere heat up sufficiently to glow and appear as meteors, and the great majority of these vaporize completely or break up before they reach the surface. Many, perhaps most, meteors occur in showers (

     ) and follow orbits that seem to be identical with those of certain comets, thus pointing to a cometary origin. For example, each May, when Earth crosses the orbit of Halley’s Comet, the Eta Aquarid meteor shower occurs. Micrometeorites (
     <xref articleid="126477">

       Four recently formed stars in the Orion nebula show what the solar system might have looked like at its birth some 4.6 billion years ago. Gravity collapsed dense globules of dust and gas into each of the four stars. The outer material formed into the surrounding protoplanetary disks, which are believed to be the precursors of planets. The bright glow in each image is the star, and the dark oval is the protoplanetary disk seen at an angle.

     probably formed by condensation of the central region of a large cloud of gas and dust, with the

     and other bodies of the solar system forming soon after, their composition strongly influenced by the temperature and pressure gradients in the evolving

     </xref>
     . Less-volatile materials could condense into solids relatively close to the Sun to form the terrestrial planets. The abundant, volatile lighter elements could condense only at much greater distances to form the giant gas planets.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the 1990s astronomers confirmed that other stars have one or more planets revolving around them. Studies of these planetary systems have both supported and challenged astronomers’ theoretical models of how Earth’s solar system formed. Unlike the solar system, many extrasolar planetary systems have large gas giants like
     <xref articleid="110150">
      Jupiter
     </xref>
     orbiting very close to their
     <xref articleid="110472">
      stars
     </xref>
     , and in some cases these “hot Jupiters” are closer to their star than
     <xref articleid="110145">
      Mercury
     </xref>
     is to the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     That so many gas giants, which form in the outer regions of their system, end up so close to their stars suggests that gas giants migrate and that such migration may have happened in the solar system’s history. According to the Grand Tack hypothesis, Jupiter may have done so within a few million years of the solar system’s formation. In this scenario, Jupiter is the first giant planet to form, at about 3 AU from the Sun. Drag from the protoplanetary disk causes it to fall inward to about 1.5 AU. However, by this time,
     <xref articleid="110151">
      Saturn
     </xref>
     begins to form at about 3 AU and captures Jupiter in a 3:2 resonance. (That is, for every three revolutions Jupiter makes, Saturn makes two.) The two planets migrate outward and clear away any material that would have gone to making
     <xref articleid="110149">
      Mars
     </xref>
     bigger. Mars should be bigger than
     <xref articleid="110146">
      Venus
     </xref>
     or Earth, but it is only half their size. The Grand Tack, in which Jupiter moves inward and then outward, explains Mars’s small size.
    </p>
    <p>
     About 500 million years after the Grand Tack, according to the Nice Model (named after the
     <xref articleid="55700">
      French city
     </xref>
     where it was first proposed), after the four giant planets—Jupiter, Saturn,
     <xref articleid="110152">
      Uranus
     </xref>
     , and
     <xref articleid="110153">
      Neptune
     </xref>
     —formed, they orbited 5–17 AU from the Sun. These planets were in a disk of smaller bodies called
     <xref articleid="60302">
      planetesimals
     </xref>
     and in orbital resonances with each other. About four billion years ago, gravitational interactions with the planetesimals increased the eccentricity of the planets’ orbits, driving them out of resonance. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune migrated outward, and Jupiter migrated slightly inward. (Uranus and Neptune may even have switched places.) This migration scattered the disk, causing the Late Heavy Bombardment. The final remnant of the disk became the
     <xref articleid="342992">
      Kuiper belt
     </xref>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The origin of the planetary satellites is not entirely settled. As to the origin of the Moon, the opinion of astronomers long oscillated between theories that saw its origin and condensation as simultaneous with the formation of Earth and those that posited a separate origin for the Moon and its later capture by Earth’s
     <xref articleid="106265">

     and their
     <xref articleid="110412">

     </xref>
     on Earth and the Moon challenged each group of theories. Finally, in the 1980s a model emerged that gained the support of most lunar scientists—that of a large impact on Earth and the expulsion of material that subsequently formed the Moon. (

     .) For the outer planets, with their multiple satellites, many very small and quite unlike one another, the picture is less clear. Some of these moons have relatively smooth icy surfaces, whereas others are heavily cratered; at least one, Jupiter’s
     <xref articleid="42680">

     A general model of star formation and evolution has been developed, and the major features seem to be established. A large cloud of gas and dust can contract under its own
     <xref articleid="106265">
      gravitational
     </xref>
     attraction if its temperature is sufficiently low. As gravitational energy is released, the contracting central material heats up until a point is reached at which the outward
     <xref articleid="109464">
      radiation
     </xref>
     pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, and contraction ceases. Fusion reactions take over as the star’s primary source of energy, and the star is then on the main sequence. The time to pass through these formative stages and onto the main sequence is less than 100 million years for a star with as much mass as the Sun. It takes longer for less massive stars and a much shorter time for those much more massive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once a star has reached its main-sequence stage, it evolves relatively slowly, fusing

     Stellar evolution has of necessity been followed through computer modeling, because the timescales for most stages are generally too extended for measurable changes to be observed, even over a period of many years. One exception is the

      white dwarf star
     </xref>
     attracts matter from a nearby companion; when the white dwarf’s mass exceeds about 1.4 solar masses, the star implodes and is completely destroyed. Type II supernovas are not as luminous as Type Ia and are the final evolutionary stage of stars more massive than about eight solar masses. Type Ib and Ic supernovas are like Type II in that they are from the collapse of a massive star, but they do not retain their hydrogen envelope.

The black hole is 6.5 billion times more massive than the Sun. This image was the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow. The ring is brighter on one side because the black hole is rotating, and thus material on the side of the black hole turning toward Earth has its emission boosted by the Doppler effect. The shadow of the black hole is about five and a half times larger than the event horizon, the boundary marking the black hole’s limits, where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. This image was released in 2019 and created from data collected in 2017.

The importance to astronomers of globular clusters lies in their use as indicators of the age of the galaxy. Because massive stars evolve more rapidly than do smaller stars, the age of a cluster can be estimated from its

    . In a young cluster the main sequence will be well populated, but in an old cluster the heavier stars will have evolved away from the main sequence. The extent of the depopulation of the main sequence provides an index of age. In this way, the oldest globular clusters have been found to be about 12.5 billion years old, which should therefore be the minimum age for the galaxy.

   <p>
    Observational support for this general model comes from several independent directions. The expansion has been documented by the redshifts observed in the spectra of galaxies. Furthermore, the radiation left over from the original fireball would have cooled with the expansion. Confirmation of this relic energy came in 1965 with one of the most striking cosmic discoveries of the 20th century—the observation, at short radio wavelengths, of a widespread cosmic radiation corresponding to a temperature of almost 3 K (about −270 °C [−454 °F]). The shape of the observed spectrum is an excellent fit with the theoretical Planck

    <xref articleid="471314">

    .) The spectrum of this cosmic radio noise peaks at approximately a one-millimetre wavelength, which is in the far infrared, a difficult region to observe from Earth; however, the spectrum has been well mapped by the

    Early surveys of the cosmic background radiation indicated that it is extremely uniform in all directions (isotropic). Calculations have shown that it is difficult to achieve this degree of isotropy unless there was a very early and rapid inflationary period before the expansion settled into its present mode. Nevertheless, the isotropy posed problems for models of galaxy formation. Galaxies originate from turbulent conditions that produce local fluctuations of density, toward which more matter would then be gravitationally attracted. Such density variations were difficult to reconcile with the isotropy required by observations of the 3 K radiation. This problem was solved when the COBE satellite was able to detect the minute fluctuations in the cosmic background from which the galaxies formed.

In 2003 a calculation based on a fresh determination of Hubble’s constant yielded an age of 13.7 billion ± 200 million years, although the precise value depends on certain assumed details of the model used. Independent estimates of stellar ages have yielded values less than this, as would be expected, but other estimates, based on
    <xref articleid="70402">
     supernova
    </xref>
    distance measurements, have arrived at values of about 15 billion years, still consistent, within the errors. In the big bang model the age is proportional to the reciprocal of Hubble’s constant, hence the importance of determining
    <e type="italic">
     H
    </e>
    as reliably as possible. For example, a value for
    <e type="italic">
     H
    </e>
    of 100 km/sec/Mpc would lead to an age less than that of many stars, a physically unacceptable result.
   </p>
   <p>
    A small minority of astronomers have developed alternative cosmological theories that are seriously pursued. The overwhelming professional opinion, however, continues to support the big bang model.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, there is the question of the future behaviour of the universe: Is it open? That is to say, will the expansion continue indefinitely? Or is it closed, such that the expansion will slow down and eventually reverse, resulting in contraction? (The final collapse of such a contracting universe is sometimes termed the “big crunch.”) The density of the universe seems to be at the critical density; that is, the universe is neither open nor closed but “flat.” So-called
    <xref articleid="471077">
     dark energy
    </xref>
    , a kind of repulsive force that is now believed to be a major component of the universe, appears to be the decisive factor in predictions of the long-term fate of the cosmos. If this energy is a cosmological constant (as proposed in 1917 by
    <xref articleid="106018">
     Albert Einstein
    </xref>
    to correct certain problems in his model of the universe), then the result would be a “big chill.” In this scenario, the universe would continue to expand, but its density would decrease. While old stars would burn out, new stars would no longer form. The universe would become cold and dark. The
    <xref articleid="471078">
     dark (nonluminous) matter
    </xref>
    component of the universe, whose composition remains unknown, is not considered sufficient to close the universe and cause it to collapse; it now appears to contribute only a fourth of the density needed for closure.
   </p>
   <p>
    An additional factor in deciding the fate of the universe might be the mass of
    <xref articleid="55405">
     neutrinos
    </xref>
    . For decades the neutrino had been postulated to have zero mass, although there was no compelling theoretical reason for this to be so. From the observation of neutrinos generated in the

Accurate pointing and timing are required to permit the correlation of observations made with different instrument systems working in different wavelength intervals and located at places far apart. The radiation must be spectrally analyzed so that the processes responsible for radiation emission can be identified.

     Galileo Galilei
    </xref>
    ’s use of telescopes for astronomy in 1609, all observations were made by naked eye, with corresponding limits on the faintness and degree of detail that could be seen. Since that time, telescopes have become central to astronomy. Having
    <xref articleid="7991">
     apertures
    </xref>
    much larger than the pupil of the
    <xref articleid="109527">

    </xref>
    , telescopes permit the study of faint and distant objects. In addition, sufficient radiant energy can be collected in short time intervals to permit rapid fluctuations in intensity to be detected. Further, with more energy collected, a spectrum can be greatly dispersed and examined in much greater detail.
   </p>

    Optical telescopes are either refractors or reflectors that use
    <xref articleid="47770">
     lenses
    </xref>
    or
    <xref articleid="52946">
     mirrors
    </xref>
    , respectively, for their main light-collecting elements (objectives). Refractors are effectively limited to apertures of about 100 cm (approximately 40 inches) or less because of problems inherent in the use of large
    <xref articleid="36988">
     glass
    </xref>
    lenses. These distort under their own weight and can be supported only around the perimeter; an appreciable amount of light is lost due to absorption in the glass. Large-aperture refractors are very long and require large and expensive domes. The largest modern telescopes are all reflectors, the very largest composed of many segmented components and having overall diameters of about 10 metres (33 feet). Reflectors are not subject to the chromatic problems of refractors, can be better supported mechanically, and can be housed in smaller domes because they are more compact than the long-tube refractors.
   </p>
   <p>
    The angular resolving power (or resolution) of a telescope is the smallest angle between close objects that can be seen clearly to be separate. Resolution is limited by the wave nature of light. For a telescope having an objective lens or mirror with diameter
    <e type="italic">
     D
    </e>
    and operating at wavelength λ, the angular resolution (in radians) can be approximately described by the ratio λ/
    <e type="italic">
     D
    </e>
    . Optical telescopes can have very high intrinsic resolving powers; in practice, however, these are not attained for telescopes located on Earth’s surface, because atmospheric effects limit the practical resolution to about one arc second. Sophisticated computing programs can allow much-improved resolution, and the performance of telescopes on Earth can be improved through the use of adaptive optics, in which the surface of the mirror is adjusted rapidly to compensate for atmospheric turbulence that would otherwise distort the image. In addition, image data from several telescopes focused on the same object can be merged optically and through computer processing to produce images having angular resolutions much greater than that from any single component.

    Theory is just as important as observation in astronomy. It is required for the interpretation of observational data; for the construction of models of celestial objects and physical processes, their properties, and their changes over time; and for guiding further observations. Theoretical astrophysics is based on laws of

     physics
    </xref>
    that have been validated with great precision through controlled experiments. Application of these laws to specific astrophysical problems, however, may yield equations too complex for direct solution. Two general approaches are then available. In the traditional method, a simplified description of the problem is formulated, incorporating only the major physical components, to provide equations that can be either solved directly or used to create a numerical model that can be evaluated (

   History of astronomy

  <p>
   Astronomy was the first natural science to reach a high level of sophistication and predictive ability, which it achieved already in the second half of the 1st millennium
   <e type="smallcap">
    bce
   </e>
   . The early quantitative success of astronomy, compared with other natural sciences such as
   <xref articleid="108654">

   ,
   <xref articleid="108655">
    chemistry
   </xref>
   ,
   <xref articleid="110576">
    biology
   </xref>
   , and
   <xref articleid="472863">
    meteorology
   </xref>
   (which were also cultivated in antiquity but which did not reach the same level of accomplishment), stems from several causes. First, the subject matter of early astronomy had the advantage of stability and simplicity—the
   <xref articleid="110144">
    Sun
   </xref>
   , the
   <xref articleid="110148">
    Moon
   </xref>
   , the
   <xref articleid="60298">
    planets
   </xref>
   , and the
   <xref articleid="110472">
    stars
   </xref>
   , moving in complex patterns, to be sure, but with great underlying regularity. Biology is far more complicated. Second, the subject was easily mathematized, and already in
   <xref articleid="106269">
    Greek antiquity
   </xref>
   astronomy was frequently regarded as a branch of
   <xref articleid="109827">
    mathematics
   </xref>
   . This may seem a paradox to a modern reader, since mathematized sciences are regarded as difficult. But in ancient
   <xref articleid="11620">
    Babylonia
   </xref>
   and Greece, it was precisely because the motions of the planets could be subjected to mathematical treatment that astronomy made such rapid headway. By contrast, physics failed to make great gains until the 17th century, when its subject matter finally was successfully mathematized. And third, astronomy benefited from its close connection with
   <xref articleid="63138">
    religion
   </xref>
   and
   <xref articleid="108652">
    philosophy
   </xref>
   , which provided a social value that other sciences simply could not match.
  </p>
  <p>
   The astronomical tradition is of impressive duration and continuity. A few Babylonian observations of
   <xref articleid="110146">
    Venus
   </xref>
   are preserved from the early 2nd millennium
   <e type="smallcap">
    bce
   </e>
   , and the Babylonians brought their science to a high level by the 4th century
   <e type="smallcap">
    bce
   </e>
   . For the next half millennium, the greatest headway was made by Greek astronomers, who put their own stamp on the subject but who built on what the Babylonians had accomplished. In the early Middle Ages the leading language of astronomical learning was Arabic, as Greek had been before. Astronomers in
   <xref articleid="106443">
    Islamic lands
   </xref>
   mastered what the Greeks had accomplished and soon added to it. With the revival of learning in Europe, and the European
   <xref articleid="63161">
    Renaissance
   </xref>
   , the leading language of astronomy became
   <xref articleid="47290">
    Latin
   </xref>
   . The European astronomers drew first on Greek astronomy, as translated from Arabic, before acquiring direct access to the classics of Greek science. Thus, modern astronomy is part of a continuous tradition, now almost 4,000 years long, that cuts across multiple cultures and languages. This article focuses on this central story line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In doing so, there is regrettably little space for other fascinating branches of the history of astronomy. New World astronomy, for example, developed in complete independence but did not rise to so advanced a level. In China astronomy developed to a much higher level, but there too (despite intermittent contacts with Islamic and Indian astronomy and even a fascinating hint of Babylonian influence in the Chinese reckoning of days in 60-day intervals) the story is largely a separate one. That changed with the 16th- and 17th-century
   <xref articleid="43579">
    Jesuit
   </xref>
   missions to China, which brought European and Chinese astronomy into direct contact. In India too astronomy reached a high level, involving original Indian methods as well as Indian adaptations of Babylonian and Greek methods, often obtained through Persian contacts. All these branches of the history of astronomy are fascinating and fully merit their own account, but they do not form a part of the main story line of this article.

     <xref articleid="571104">

     . Some other astronomical alignments in Stonehenge, such as with the Moon’s most southerly rising and most northerly setting point, are accepted by many archaeoastronomers. However, most discount some of the more extravagant claims—e.g., that Stonehenge functioned as an

     predictor.
    </p>
    <p>
     That prehistoric people should have noticed and kept track of the Sun and the Moon is not astonishing, but because they lived before writing, the meanings that they attached to celestial events are bound to remain obscure. Some early work in archaeoastronomy was harmed by too great a reliance on conjecture, but methods have greatly improved. Modern archaeoastronomers realize that, with enough stones to work with, one can always find some alignment that is correlated with something celestial. Therefore, one must be careful to perform adequate statistical tests to make sure the alignments are significant and not just accidental.

     Mesopotamia

    <p>
     The earliest sophisticated astronomy arose in ancient
     <xref articleid="11620">
      Babylonia
     </xref>
     , in central
     <xref articleid="108642">

     , and there are three reasons why it happened there rather than, say, in
     <xref articleid="106269">
      ancient Greece
     </xref>
     . First, in Babylonia astronomy had an important social function: the gods sent signs from heaven to warn the king about impending war, a bad
     <xref articleid="13391">
      barley
     </xref>
     harvest, or an impending epidemic. In the early 2nd millennium
     <e type="smallcap">
      bce
     </e>
     , the pattern of taking celestial omens was already established. This was long before the rise of personal
     <xref articleid="108511">
      astrology
     </xref>
     ; whereas common people might have taken signs from their surroundings—for example, by observing the behaviour of animals—the celestial signs were intended for the king and kingdom alone. The Greeks were no less superstitious than any other ancient people and saw omens in the flight of
     <xref articleid="105921">
      birds
     </xref>
     , in dreams, or in the frenzied utterances of an oracle, but they had no early custom of celestial divination. That came later, in the
     <xref articleid="106270">
      Hellenistic
     </xref>
     period, after contact with Babylonian wisdom. Second, there was in Babylonia a civil service charged with things astronomical. Temple scribes, who were often priests, watched the sky every night to keep track of what transpired, and they recorded their observations. Third, in Mesopotamia there existed a stable technology for recording data—the clay tablet. As long as they are protected from water, clay tablets are practically indestructible. The acquired data also had a secure place for storage (the temples), and broken tablets were recopied. All of these circumstances—a social function, a bureaucracy charged with doing astronomy, and a secure system for data storage—were missing in the early Greek world.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the 7th century
     <e type="smallcap">
      bce
     </e>
     , astronomical diaries were in existence. These recorded the results of night-by-night watching by the temple astronomers, such as when a
     <xref articleid="60298">
      planet
     </xref>
     passed by the Pleiades or another reference star, when
     <xref articleid="110146">
      Venus
     </xref>
     reemerged from its period of invisibility (after having been too near the Sun), or when
     <xref articleid="110150">
      Jupiter
     </xref>
     stood still and went into retrograde motion (that is, reversed direction). These ancient Babylonian observations were not very precise, but it is far more important to have a long run of observations than to have precise ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within a few generations, Babylonian astronomers had achieved the ability to predict the behaviour of the Moon and the planets. Though no planet repeats its motion from one year to the next, repetition does occur if one waits long enough. For example, Venus does not go into retrograde in the same month or in the same sign of the
     <xref articleid="78420">
      zodiac
     </xref>
     from one retrogradation to the next. The pattern does not repeat until after 5 complete retrograde cycles, which take about 8 years. Similarly,
     <xref articleid="110149">
      Mars
     </xref>
     starts a new repeating pattern of retrogradations after 22 cycles (which take 47 years), and
     <xref articleid="110151">
      Saturn
     </xref>
     repeats its pattern after 57 retrogradations (59 years). This discovery gave rise to the Babylonian goal-year texts. Supposing that one wanted to predict the behaviour of all the planets for the year 2025, which would be the goal year, one could look back in the records and find what Venus had done in 2017 (8 years earlier), what Mars had done in 1978 (47 years earlier), and so on. Thus, the first predictive planetary astronomy was achieved with a good database by making use of repeating patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
     By about 300
     <e type="smallcap">
      bce
     </e>
     the temple scribes achieved a far more sophisticated method of predicting planetary behaviour on the basis of complex arithmetical theories. For each planet there are several different versions of the planetary theory preserved. The basic idea was that a key event, such as the onset of retrogradation, could be thought of as an object in its own right that worked its way around the zodiac. For example, in one version of the Babylonian theory, Jupiter’s onsets of retrograde motion were spaced at regular intervals of 30° though about half the zodiac (in Jupiter’s slow zone) but at 36° intervals in the remainder of the zodiac (Jupiter’s fast zone). A scribe could use this theory to rapidly work out the dates and positions in the zodiac of the onsets of Jupiter’s retrograde motion for a century or more.

      applied geometrical reasoning to estimate the distances of the Sun and the Moon, in
      <e type="italic">
       On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon
      </e>
      . However, his initial premises included several questionable numerical values. For example, he assumed that at the moment of quarter Moon, the angle between the Sun and the Moon, as observed from Earth, is 87°. From this it followed that the Sun’s distance is about 19 times the Moon’s distance from us. (The actual ratio is about 389.) A second doubtful observation was that the angular size of the Sun or the Moon is 2° (the actual value is about 0.5°). Although the numerical inputs were flawed, Aristarchus’s method was valid. He found the Moon’s diameter to be between 0.32 and 0.4 times the diameter of Earth, and the Sun’s diameter to be between 6.3 and 7.2 times the diameter of Earth. (The diameters of the Moon and the Sun compared with that of Earth are actually 0.27 and 109, respectively.) By the time of

      (2nd century

      ), improvements on Aristarchus’s method had led to excellent values for the size and distance of the Moon. But the ancients always considerably underestimated the size and distance of the Sun, which is so far from Earth that a measurement of its

      Greek thinking about the motion of the planets began by about 400

      .
      <xref articleid="33194">
       Eudoxus of Cnidus
      </xref>
      constructed the first Greek theory of planetary motion of which any details are known. In a book,
      <e type="italic">
       On Speeds
      </e>
      (which is lost but was briefly discussed by
      <xref articleid="108312">
       Aristotle
      </xref>
      and
      <xref articleid="67870">
       Simplicius
      </xref>
      ), Eudoxus regarded each celestial body as carried on a set of concentric spheres, which nest one inside another. For each planet, three different motions must be accounted for, and Eudoxus proposed to do this with four spheres. The daily revolution to the west is accounted for by the outermost sphere (1). Next inside is sphere 2, whose axle fits into sphere 1 at an offset of about 24°; sphere 2 turns to the east in the planet’s zodiacal period (12 years for
      <xref articleid="110150">
       Jupiter
      </xref>
      , 30 years for
      <xref articleid="110151">
       Saturn
      </xref>
      ). The third motion is retrograde motion. For this, Eudoxus used a combination of two spheres (3 and 4). The planet itself rides on the equator circle of sphere 4. The axle of 4 fits inside sphere 3 with a slight angular offset. Spheres 3 and 4 turn in opposite directions but at the same speed. The motion of the planet resulting from the gyrations of spheres 3 and 4 is a figure eight, which lies in the spherical surface. Eudoxus likely understood the mathematical characteristics of this curve, as he gave it the name
      <e type="italic">
       hippopede
      </e>
      (horse fetter). The two-sphere assembly of 3 and 4 is inserted into the inner surface of sphere 2. Thus, all three motions are accounted for, at least qualitatively: the daily motion to the west by sphere 1, the slow motion eastward around the zodiac by sphere 2, and the occasional retrograde motion by the two-sphere assembly of 3 and 4. Eudoxus’s theory is sometimes called the theory of homocentric spheres, as all the spheres have the same centre, Earth.
     </p>
     <p>
      At this stage, Greek astronomers were more interested in providing plausible physical accounts of the universe and in proving geometrical theorems than in providing numerically accurate descriptions of planetary motion. Eudoxus’s successor Callippus made some improvements to the model. Nevertheless, the homocentric spheres were criticized for their failure to account for the fact that some planets (notably
      <xref articleid="110149">
       Mars
      </xref>
      and
      <xref articleid="110146">
       Venus
      </xref>
      ) are much brighter at some times of their cycles than at others. Eudoxus’s system was soon abandoned as a theory for the motion of the planets, but it exerted a profound influence in cosmology, for the cosmos continued to be regarded as a set of concentric spheres until the
      <xref articleid="63161">

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Late in the 3rd century
      <e type="smallcap">
       bce
      </e>
      , alternative theoretical models were developed, based on eccentric circles and epicycles. (An eccentric circle is a circle that is slightly off-centre from
      <xref articleid="110147">
       Earth
      </xref>
      , and an epicycle is a circle that is carried and rides around on another circle.) This innovation is usually attributed to
      <xref articleid="8024">
       Apollonius of Perga
      </xref>
      (
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      220
      <e type="smallcap">
       bce
      </e>
      ), but it is not conclusively known who first proposed these models. In considering the Sun’s motion, Eudoxus’s theory of homocentric spheres ignored the fact that the
      <xref articleid="110144">
       Sun
      </xref>
      appears to speed up and slow down in the course of the year as it moves around the
      <xref articleid="78420">
       zodiac
      </xref>
      . (This is clear from spring’s being several days longer than fall.) An eccentric (i.e., off-centre) circle can explain this fact. The Sun is still considered to travel at constant speed around a perfect circle, but the centre of the circle is slightly displaced from Earth. When the Sun is closest to Earth, it appears to travel a little more rapidly in the zodiac. When it is farthest away, it appears to travel a little more slowly. As far as is known, Hipparchus was the first to deduce the amount and direction of the off-centredness, basing his calculations on the measured length of the
      <xref articleid="66491">
       seasons
      </xref>
      . According to Hipparchus, the off-centredness of the Sun’s circle is about 4 percent of its radius. The eccentric-circle theory was capable of excellent accuracy in accounting for the observed motion of the Sun and remained standard until the 17th century.
     </p>
     <p>
      The standard theory of the planets involved an eccentric circle, which carried an epicycle. Imagine looking down on the plane of the solar system from above its north pole. The planet moves counterclockwise on its epicycle. Meanwhile, the centre of the epicycle moves counterclockwise around the eccentric circle, which is centred near (but not quite exactly at) Earth. As viewed from Earth, the planet will appear to move backward (that is, go into retrograde motion) when it is at the inner part of the epicycle (closest to Earth), for this is when the westward motion of the planet on the epicycle is more than enough to overcome the eastward motion of the epicycle’s centre forward around the eccentric.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hipparchus played a major role in introducing Babylonian numerical parameters into Greek astronomy. Indeed, an important shift in Greek attitudes toward astronomy occurred about this time. The Babylonian example served as a sort of wake-up call to the Greeks. Previous Greek planetary thinking had been more about getting the right big picture, based on philosophical principles and geometrical models (whether using Eudoxus’s concentric spheres or
      <xref articleid="8024">
       Apollonius’s
      </xref>
      epicycles and eccentrics). The Babylonians had no geometrical models but instead focused on devising arithmetical theories that had real predictive power. Hipparchus achieved numerically successful geometrical theories for the Sun and the Moon, but he did not succeed with the
      <xref articleid="60298">
       planets
      </xref>
      . He contented himself with showing that the planetary theories then in circulation did not agree with the phenomena. Nevertheless, Hipparchus’s insistence that a geometrical theory, if it is true, ought to work in detail marked a major step in Greek astronomy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another of Hipparchus’s contributions was the discovery of
      <xref articleid="61231">
       precession
      </xref>
      , the slow eastward motion of the stars around the zodiac caused by wobbling, over a period of 25,772 years, in the orientation of Earth’s axis of rotation. Hipparchus’s writings on this subject have not survived, but his ideas can be reconstructed from summaries given by
      <xref articleid="61778">
       Ptolemy
      </xref>
      . Hipparchus used observations of several fixed stars, taken with respect to the
      <xref articleid="106197">
       eclipsed
      </xref>
      Moon, which had been made by some of his predecessors. On comparing these with eclipse observations he had made himself, he deduced that the fixed stars move eastward not less than 1° in 100 years. The
      <xref articleid="11620">
       Babylonians
      </xref>
      , in their theories, revised their locations of the equinoxes and solstices. For example, in one version of the Babylonian theory, the
      <xref articleid="610317">
       spring equinox
      </xref>
      is said to occur at the 10th degree of
      <xref articleid="9423">
       Aries
      </xref>
      ; in another version, at the 8th degree. Some historians have maintained that this reflects a Babylonian awareness of precession, on which Hipparchus might have drawn. Other historians have argued that the evidence is not clear and that these differing norms for the equinox may represent nothing more than alternative conventions.

        In Ptolemy’s geocentric model of the universe, the Sun, the Moon, and each planet orbit a stationary Earth. For the Greeks, heavenly bodies must move in the most perfect possible fashion—hence, in perfect circles. In order to retain such motion and still explain the erratic apparent paths of the bodies, Ptolemy shifted the centre of each body’s orbit (deferent) from Earth—accounting for the body’s apogee and perigee—and added a second orbital motion (epicycle) to explain retrograde motion. The equant is the point from which each body sweeps out equal angles along the deferent in equal times. The centre of the deferent is midway between the equant and Earth.

      <xref articleid="61778">

      </xref>
      (2nd century
      <e type="smallcap">

      </e>
      ). Ptolemy built on the work of his predecessors—notably
      <xref articleid="40534">
       Hipparchus
      </xref>
      —but his work was so successful that it made older works of planetary astronomy superfluous, and they ceased to be read and copied. An innovation that appears for the first time in the
      <e type="italic">
       Almagest
      </e>
      is the equant point. As in the planetary theories of Hipparchus’s day, a planet travels uniformly around its epicycle while the centre of the epicycle moves around Earth on an off-centre circle. But in
      <xref articleid="61760">
       Ptolemy’s theory
      </xref>
      the motion of the epicycle’s centre is nonuniform—it speeds up and slows down—which was a radical departure from
      <xref articleid="108313">
       Aristotelian
      </xref>
      physics. However, the nonuniformity is expressed in the language of uniformity: the epicycle’s centre moves in such a way that it appears to go through equal angles in equal times as viewed from another point distinct from Earth, the equant point. Though this may seem like an unnecessary complication, it was just what an explanation of planetary motion required (for, in the modern view, planets really do move nonuniformly). In Ptolemy, for the first time, Greek geometrical planetary theory finally achieved real numerical accuracy. Ptolemy’s theory actually predicted the behaviour of the planets, and it dominated the practice of astronomy for 1,400 years.

      , which was probably based substantially on an earlier catalog by Hipparchus but with additions and modifications by Ptolemy. It also contains Ptolemy’s improvement on Hipparchus’s lunar theory. As an aid to convenient calculation, Ptolemy also composed the

     </p>
     <p>
      Historians have long debated how much credit to give Ptolemy and how much to assign to his predecessors. For an ancient scientist, he was unusually generous in crediting his predecessors, particularly Hipparchus, for discoveries. But he did not always mention the origin of his ideas. In any case, Ptolemy’s publications fundamentally changed the way astronomy was done in the
      <xref articleid="106270">
       Greek world
      </xref>
      . In the period between Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Greek astronomers had struggled without great success to make geometrical planetary theory work. From the evidence of Greek-inspired astronomical works that later turned up in India, it has been conjectured that Greek astronomers before Ptolemy may have experimented with nonuniform motion—something akin to the equant—but nothing remains of a finished project before Ptolemy.

      <e type="italic">
       Handy Tables
      </e>
      . Thus, in Greek astronomy there was a high road based on philosophy of nature and rooted in geometrical methods, and there was a low road based on the convenient arithmetical methods adapted from the Babylonians, even if these could not be considered to rest on adequate physical or philosophical foundations. These two methods still existed side by side up to the time of Ptolemy, and even a little after, but the newly successful (and convenient) geometrical methods gradually won out.

      Ptolemy also wrote a speculative cosmological work, the
      <e type="italic">
       Hypotheseis ton planomenon
      </e>
      (
      <e type="italic">
       Planetary Hypotheses

      ), in which he took the eccentric-and-epicycle astronomy of the
      <e type="italic">
       Almagest
      </e>
      as physically true. However, to give a satisfactory image of the cosmos, he needed the nested-spheres cosmology of Eudoxus. The eccentrics and epicycles were regarded as the equator circles of three-dimensional orbs. Assuming that there was no wasted or empty space in the cosmos (consistent with both Aristotelian and
      <xref articleid="108675">
       Stoic
      </xref>
      physics), Ptolemy supposed that the mechanism for
      <xref articleid="110145">
       Mercury
      </xref>
      must lie immediately above the mechanism for the
      <xref articleid="110148">

      . The mechanism for
      <xref articleid="110146">

      came next, and so on, out to the mechanism for
      <xref articleid="110151">
       Saturn
      </xref>
      , and finally the sphere of the fixed stars. (Historians are not all agreed on whether the ancients regarded these mechanisms as real, physical objects that moved the planets or as merely theoretical constructions, but Ptolemy probably considered them as real things.) The known distance of the Moon provided the scale. When the numbers were worked out, the distance of the fixed stars was about 20,000 Earth radii. This is an enormous cosmos (though much smaller than modern estimates). Accepting such a conclusion, based on planetary astronomy and a few auxiliary physical premises, required a certain courage of imagination.

Arabic astronomers also noted that the seasons had changed slightly in length from the values recorded by Ptolemy. This implied that the solar apogee has a slow motion to the east. Thus, the centre of the Sun’s circle can be regarded as revolving very slowly about Earth. This motion was represented in al-Battānī’s

     and of the

Al-Ṭūsī applied his two-circle mechanism (called an “al-Ṭūsī couple” by modern scholars) to produce the same phenomena in what seemed to him a physically more plausible way. Al-Ṭūsī’s student al-Shīrāzī went farther, using a minor epicycle to eliminate the need for an equant point. In the 14th century Ibn al-Shāṭir of Damascus built on the works of the Marāgheh school in his

However, these efforts did not transform common practice, since the overwhelming majority of late medieval planetary tables are Ptolemaic in their underlying theory. In the 16th century

     In the 12th and 13th centuries, two developments were key to the revival of astronomy in the Latin West. The translation movement rapidly made available key works of Greek astronomy that had long been out of reach. One of the most important translators was
     <xref articleid="36534">

     </e>
     , which he had heard of but which was unavailable in Latin, he went to Spain and learned Arabic well enough to translate it. Thus, one could maintain that a major reason for the revival of learning in the West was one man’s desire to be able to read Ptolemy. Gerard translated from Arabic versions not only Ptolemy’s

Thus, the regulation of the calendar, as well as the success or failure of his astronomers to predict an eclipse, reflected either well or badly on him. Many different astronomical summaries were written in conjunction with the ascent of a new emperor.

     , had circulated in manuscript in the small astronomical community of central Europe from about 1510, but it was not printed until the 19th century.) Although Copernicus made some new observations of the
     <xref articleid="60298">
      planets
     </xref>
     and drew on some observations by his medieval predecessors, new observations played no important role in his discovery. Rather, Copernicus discovered the motion of Earth by understanding Ptolemy more deeply than anyone else had—for the essential clues lay there in the
     <e type="italic">
      Almagest
     </e>
     for all to see.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each planet’s motion is connected with the motion of the
     <xref articleid="110144">
      Sun
     </xref>
     . The inferior planets are always the close companions of the Sun.
     <xref articleid="110145">
      Mercury
     </xref>
     never gets more than about 22° from the Sun, and
     <xref articleid="110146">
      Venus
     </xref>
     never more than about 48°. This can be explained simply by imagining that these two planets circle the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the superior planets (
     <xref articleid="110149">
      Mars
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref articleid="110150">

     </xref>
     , and
     <xref articleid="110151">
      Saturn
     </xref>
     ), the connection is more subtle. Each of these planets goes into retrograde motion when it is diametrically opposite the Sun as viewed from Earth. In the ancient planetary theory, this required the three planets to move around their epicycles in lockstep with one another and with the motion of the Sun around Earth. In the case of Mars, for example, the revolving line from the epicycle’s centre to Mars must remain parallel to the revolving line from Earth to the Sun. The same holds true for Jupiter and Saturn. Ptolemy mentioned that one could use this fact to avoid duplicated calculations if one wanted to work out the positions of all three planets for the same date. Copernicus’s great insight was that these four simultaneous motions were really manifestations of one single motion—the motion of Earth itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The early reaction to Copernicus was rather muted, and astronomers had several different kinds of response. One could admire Copernicus’s mathematical abilities and simply remain agnostic on the question of Earth’s motion. Such, for example, was the position of German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold, who wrote a popular textbook of Ptolemaic astronomy but who also computed and published the
     <e type="italic">
      Prutenic Tables

     , based on Copernicus’s planetary theory, which helped boost Copernicus’s reputation.

      Tycho Brahe

     was a good example of those who admired Copernicus’s achievement in tying all the motions of the planets more closely to the Sun but who were unable to accept the motion of Earth. Brahe worked out an alternative cosmology, known as the
     <xref articleid="73974">
      Tychonic system
     </xref>
     . In this view the Moon and the Sun revolve around Earth, but all of the other planets revolve around the moving Sun. Tycho’s system had the same explanatory advantages as Copernicus’s. It was what the Copernican system would look like if Earth was made to stay at rest.

     Like many other astronomers, Tycho was fascinated by the brilliant

     that appeared in
     <xref articleid="20662">

     from night to night. For an astronomer or a philosopher of an
     <xref articleid="108313">

     frame of mind, it would be difficult to admit that a new star really could appear in the heavens; one would more likely consider it to be some sort of phenomenon in the upper reaches of the air and fire (the elements that, in
     <xref articleid="108312">
      Aristotle

     <xref articleid="58395">
      parallax
     </xref>
     (i.e., if it shifted back and forth with respect to the real stars), one could be sure that it was near Earth and not a part of the cosmic sphere. Tycho’s demonstration that the new star had no measurable parallax and that it therefore really was a star in the celestial sphere did much to dismantle the old physics.

     In 1577 there was a second gift from heaven—a particularly bright

     around the Sun. He pointed out that the comet was therefore sometimes closer to Earth, and sometimes farther away, than Venus and Mercury were. This seemed to imply that it crashed through the celestial spheres that carried these planets, thus calling into question these vast constructions.

     <e type="italic">
      Almagest
     </e>
     was still a part of the research literature. Kepler had begun with an interest in cosmology, in trying to understand God’s architecture for the solar system. Why, for example, were there six planets rather than some other number? Going back to speculations introduced by
     <xref articleid="108556">

     </xref>
     and the
     <xref articleid="108670">

     , Kepler applied first the geometry of the
     <xref articleid="343820">
      regular solids
     </xref>
     and then musical harmonies to explain various aspects of the universe. For example, there were six planets because there were only five regular solids (cube, tetrahedron, etc.), which God had used as spacers between the planetary orbs when working out the cosmic architecture. Kepler’s first book,
     <e type="italic">
      Mysterium cosmographicum
     </e>
     (“Cosmographic Mystery,” 1596), was based on this idea. As a result of this book, Kepler received an invitation to work with
     <xref articleid="16148">
      Tycho Brahe

     , but nothing happened until 1600, when Tycho left his native Denmark and relocated to Prague under the patronage of the Holy Roman emperor

      Rudolf II
     </xref>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Kepler went to Prague, hoping to obtain from Tycho better values of planetary parameters so that he could refine his cosmology. The collaboration lasted only a short time, because Tycho died in 1601. When Kepler arrived in Prague, Tycho and his assistants were involved in observations of
     <xref articleid="110149">
      Mars
     </xref>
     , which was then about to make a near approach to Earth. This turned out to be fortunate for Kepler, because only Mars and

     have large enough eccentricities to make the departures of their
     <xref articleid="57286">

     </xref>
     from circularity appreciable and Mercury is too near the Sun to be easily or often observed. After Tycho’s death Kepler gained access to his observation records. Far from being able to find ready results to use in cosmology, Kepler was forced to analyze many observations to put them into usable form.

     Kepler began as a convinced Copernican, so he put the Sun in the middle of his system, but for technical details he went back to Ptolemy. Kepler began by regarding Mars as moving on a circle that was slightly off-centre from the Sun and was following Ptolemy’s equant law. But he was unable to get this theory to match all of Tycho’s observations to better than about 8 minutes of arc (1 minute of arc = 1/60 of a degree), and he believed that Tycho’s observations were good to about 2 minutes of arc. Against his will he was forced to reexamine the fundamentals of planetary motion. This led to the first two of

     with one focus located at the Sun. The second law, which was actually discovered first, makes a small improvement on Ptolemy’s equant: a planet moves around the Sun at a variable speed in such a way that the line from the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. In

     : any two particles in the universe attract one another with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton used these laws to rederive
     <xref articleid="45134">
      Kepler’s laws

     , thus making planetary theory a branch of
     <xref articleid="108654">

     for the first time in history. He then applied the laws to explain other phenomena, such as the rise and fall of the

     The law of inertia (Newton’s first law—a body tends to move at constant speed in a straight line) had been hinted at by
     <xref articleid="105766">
      Galileo
     </xref>
     and expressed in a more definite way by French philosopher
     <xref articleid="108563">
      René Descartes
     </xref>
     . The third law (if body A exerts a force on body B, then B exerts force on A equal in magnitude but opposite in direction) was well supported by recent work on collisions by Dutch mathematician
     <xref articleid="41658">
      Christiaan Huygens
     </xref>
     and others. Newton’s second law (the force impressed on a body is equal to the body’s mass times its acceleration) represented a fresh way of thinking about motion. The idea of an inverse-square law for gravity had been toyed with in England by physicist
     <xref articleid="40979">

     </xref>
     , architect

     </xref>
     , but they had been unable to assemble all the necessary concepts—the law of attraction, the concept of motion under an impressed force, and the linking mathematics—into a finished product. Newton’s
     <e type="italic">
      Principia
     </e>
     fundamentally altered the intellectual context for the science of astronomy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Newton’s law of universal gravitation encountered some resistance, especially on the French-speaking Continent, where it was sometimes regarded as a falling back into a discredited way of thinking. The idea that one body could reach out across empty space and affect another seemed to some to be a throwback to medieval animism. It did not help that Newton could not explain the mechanism by which gravity acted.

     Testing Newton’s theory
    </title>
    <p>
     In the first part of the 18th century, the inverse-square law was subjected to several dramatic tests. The first concerned
     <xref articleid="110147">
      Earth
     </xref>
     ’s shape. Newton had argued that Earth’s rapid rotation on its axis must cause Earth to depart from perfect sphericity. Instead, Earth should be an oblate spheroid—that is, flattened at the poles like an onion. For evidence, Newton pointed to the example of
     <xref articleid="110150">
      Jupiter
     </xref>
     , which showed a noticeable flattening when seen through a
     <xref articleid="111077">
      telescope
     </xref>
     . Also, in 1672 the French scientist
     <xref articleid="63585">
      Jean Richer
     </xref>
     had carefully measured the rate of a pendulum clock near Earth’s
     <xref articleid="32837">
      Equator
     </xref>
     (by comparing it with the motion of the
     <xref articleid="110472">
      stars
     </xref>
     ) and found that the clock ran slightly slower than an identical clock in Paris. Newton argued that if Earth was flattened at the poles, Paris would be a little closer to Earth’s centre than the Equator would be. If gravity varied as the inverse square of the distance, Earth’s gravity should then be stronger in Paris than at the Equator, and thus the Paris pendulum clock would run faster. But in 1718
     <xref articleid="20656">
      Jacques Cassini
     </xref>
     announced results of a survey of the Paris meridian from Dunkirk to Collioure, made by his father,
     <xref articleid="20655">
      Gian Domenico Cassini
     </xref>
     , and himself, that seemed to show just the opposite—that Earth is elongated at the poles like a lemon. French natural philosophers, steeped in the vortex theory of Descartes, found ways of explaining this in terms of Cartesian physics. In the 1730s the French Academy of Sciences sponsored two expeditions—one to
     <xref articleid="47170">
      Lapland
     </xref>
     , led by mathematician
     <xref articleid="51494">
      Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis
     </xref>
     , and one to equatorial South America—just to settle this question. Careful geodetic and astronomical measurements were made to determine the length of a degree of the meridian for a place near the pole and a place near the Equator. The results of the Lapland expedition showed decisively that Earth was flattened at the poles, as Newton had maintained.
     <xref articleid="106001">
      Voltaire
     </xref>
     famously addressed his friend Maupertuis as “the flattener of the world and of Cassinis.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Second, Newton had been unable to calculate the correct rate for the advance of the
     <xref articleid="110148">
      Moon
     </xref>
     ’s perigee—that is, the movement of the point on the Moon’s
     <xref articleid="57286">
      orbit
     </xref>
     where it is closest to Earth. The reason for the advance of the perigee lies in the perturbing attraction of the
     <xref articleid="110144">
      Sun
     </xref>
     on the Moon, but Newton obtained a rate too small by half (a complete revolution of the perigee takes about 18 years instead of the observed 9). In the 18th century several leading mathematicians tried to solve the problem and failed. In 1747 French mathematician and physicist Alexis-Claude Clairaut proposed a modification of Newton’s law of gravity. Instead of a pure inverse-square law, Clairaut proposed adding a small term, proportional to the inverse fourth power of the distance, in order to get the motion of the Moon’s perigee to come out correctly. Clairaut later withdrew this proposal and showed in a new calculation that the inverse-square law was perfectly adequate for explaining the motion of the Moon’s perigee. The problem was too complex to be solved directly, and it was necessary to introduce approximations. Clairaut showed that the approximations made by Newton and those who followed had been too rash and that with more-careful approximations, the advance of perigee came out just right. This was, by far, the most precise test of the Newtonian theory to date.

     <xref articleid="38944">

     , celestial mechanicians undertook a more-precise calculation of the date of return. Halley had argued that the

     of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were one and the same and predicted a return for late 1758 or early 1759, but he did not live to see it happen. When the comet, on its very elongated orbit, passes by massive
     <xref articleid="60298">

     , such as Jupiter, on its way out of and back into the inner
     <xref articleid="110143">

     </xref>
     , the planets exert forces that perturb its motion. In Paris, Clairaut, astronomer
     <xref articleid="46905">
      Jérôme Lalande
     </xref>
     , and Nicole Lepauté, the wife of a well-known instrument maker, calculated the motion of the comet, including the perturbing forces. This was the most ambitious program of numerical integration ever undertaken up to that time. When the comet reappeared within their announced one-month window of error, it was seen by many as a triumph of calculation, as well as of the law of universal gravitation.

     (
     <e type="italic">
      A Treatise of Celestial Mechanics

     ; 5 vol., 1798–1825), but he was also the author of a work of popularization, the

     (
     <e type="italic">
      The System of the World
     </e>
     ), which appeared in several editions between 1796 and 1824. In this work Laplace explained for the lay reader all the phenomena of the solar system in terms of universal gravitation. This was followed by a brief history of astronomy from ancient times down to Laplace’s own day. The book ended with a brief account of what is now called Laplace’s
     <xref articleid="110143" refid="h242060">
      nebular hypothesis
     </xref>
     , a theory of the origin of the solar system. Laplace imagined that the planets had condensed from the primitive solar atmosphere, which originally extended far beyond the limits of the present-day system. As this cloud gradually contracted under the effects of gravity, it first formed rings and then amalgamated into planets. Newton had seen in the regularities of the solar system a sure sign of the wisdom and beneficence of the Creator. For example, the fact that all the planets travel around the Sun in the same direction and more or less in the same plane could be explained only by divine providence. Laplace, looking at the same facts, instead regarded them as evidence about the prehistory of the solar system. The nebular hypothesis, although only sketchily worked out, was important as an early example of an evolutionary theory in natural science, and it is notable that evolutionary thinking entered astronomy before it became important in the life sciences.

     or a nebulous star. Herschel convinced himself that he had discovered a new comet, which would not have been an unusual occurrence, but soon other astronomers demonstrated that it was moving in a nearly circular

     </xref>
     . The flattery worked, for Herschel was soon rewarded with an annual pension, which allowed him to give up teaching music and to devote himself almost completely to astronomy. Continental astronomers refused to accept Herschel’s proposed name. In 1783 German astronomer

     of trying to tie planetary distances to numerical sequences. An influential new scheme was proposed in 1766 by Prussian astronomer
     <xref articleid="72653">
      Johann Daniel Titius von Wittenberg
     </xref>
     . According to Titius, the sequence of planetary distances takes the form
     <formula>
      4, 4 + 3, 4 + 6, 4 + 12, 4 + 24, 4 + 48, 4 + 96,…
     </formula>
     Titius fixed the scale by assigning 100 to
     <xref articleid="110151">
      Saturn
     </xref>
     ’s distance from the Sun which, indeed, makes
     <xref articleid="110145">
      Mercury
     </xref>
     ’s distance about 4. Titius pointed out that there is an empty place at distance 28, corresponding to the large gap between
     <xref articleid="110149">
      Mars
     </xref>
     and
     <xref articleid="110150">

     , and speculated that this gap would be filled by undiscovered satellites of
     <xref articleid="110149">
      Mars

     . Titius had slipped his distance rule, unsigned, into his German translation of Swiss philosopher Charles Bonnet’s

     (
     <e type="italic">

      Deutliche Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels
     </e>
     (“Clear Guide to the Starry Heaven”; 2nd ed., 1772). (In later editions Bode did give credit to Titius.) Bode also predicted that a planet would eventually be found at distance 28. Herschel’s discovery of Uranus at distance 192 (where the

     Herschel and the Milky Way
    </title>
    <p>
     Although Herschel’s discovery of Uranus made his reputation, it was far from being his most important contribution. During the 18th century, astronomers had measured the
     <xref articleid="61555">
      proper motions
     </xref>
     of a reasonably large number of
     <xref articleid="110472">
      stars
     </xref>
     . (Proper motion is the slow drift of a star with respect to its neighbours, which slowly causes the
     <xref articleid="26007">
      constellations
     </xref>
     to change shape. The first few proper motions were announced in 1718 by
     <xref articleid="38943">
      Halley
     </xref>
     , who found them by comparing recently observed star positions with data recorded in
     <xref articleid="61778">
      Ptolemy
     </xref>
     ’s
     <e type="italic">
      Almagest
     </e>
     .) Herschel noted that many of the stars with substantial proper motions are bright, which suggests that they might be nearby. He reasoned that if there is any pattern in the stellar proper motions, it might be due to the motion of the Sun through the field of stars. In 1783 Herschel published an analysis of 19 proper motions and concluded that the
     <xref articleid="110144">
      Sun
     </xref>
     is traveling through space in the direction of the constellation
     <xref articleid="476940">
      Hercules
     </xref>
     (toward a point called the solar apex). This was later questioned by the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician
     <xref articleid="78931">
      Friedrich Bessel
     </xref>
     , who had many more proper motions to work with, but Herschel’s conclusion was ultimately proved correct.
    </p>
    <p>
     Herschel was not only an excellent observer but also a remarkably inventive thinker in devising simplifying assumptions that allowed him to make theoretical progress. He was one of several people who in the mid- to late 18th century arrived at the idea that the
     <xref articleid="110643">
      Milky Way
     </xref>
     has the form of a flattened disk. However, only Herschel actually tried to deduce the structure of this vast star system. If one had a
     <xref articleid="111077">
      telescope
     </xref>
     sufficiently powerful to penetrate to the edge of the Milky Way and aimed the telescope in a direction lying in the plane of the Milky Way, one would look through a region dense with stars. In fact, the number of stars seen in the telescope’s field of view could be taken as a measure of the distance from the Sun to the edge of the Milky Way in that direction. Herschel made a large number of such counts, which he called “star gages,” and in 1785 drew the first quantitative chart of the Milky Way’s form. Later, when he realized that his telescope had not actually been powerful enough to penetrate to the galaxy’s edge, he abandoned this drawing. But because there was nothing that might replace it, Herschel’s drawing of the form of the Milky Way was frequently reprinted throughout the 19th century.

     Herschel and his sister
     <xref articleid="40233">
      Caroline Herschel
     </xref>
     expended prodigious time and effort in cataloging the
     <xref articleid="108754">
      nebulae
     </xref>
     . A few small nebulous, or cloudlike, patches in the night sky are visible to the naked eye and had been mentioned by ancient Greek and medieval Arabic astronomers. In 1755 German philosopher
     <xref articleid="108443">
      Immanuel Kant
     </xref>
     suggested that these nebulae might be vast systems of stars, comparable to the Milky Way. These later came to be called “island universes,” but at this stage the notion was purely speculative. Nebulae could be troublesome, since astronomers on the lookout for new comets could easily mistake an uncataloged nebula for a comet. In 1771 French astronomer
     <xref articleid="52247">
      Charles Messier
     </xref>
     published a list of 45 nebulae to keep himself and other comet searchers from wasting time. In 1784 his list was expanded to 103. These Messier objects are today favourite objects for amateur astronomers. William Herschel received a copy of one of Messier’s lists. Caroline, who swept for comets by using a special telescope that William had made for her, soon noticed nebulae not on Messier’s list. As a consequence, William became interested in nebulae and systematically searched for them while engaged in other observing chores. Over 20 years he raised the number of known nebulae to about 2,500. It had been known since
     <xref articleid="105766">
      Galileo
     </xref>
     that through a good telescope, some nebulae could be resolved into stars. Were the nebulae really all star systems at vast distances from
     <xref articleid="110147">
      Earth
     </xref>
     , or were there also regions of true nebulosity, clouds of luminous fluid? Recent drawings of the

     , when compared with a drawing made by
     <xref articleid="41658">
      Christiaan Huygens
     </xref>
     in the 17th century, seemed to show that this nebula had changed form, which implied that it had to be close, relatively small, and not made of stars. Herschel’s opinions changed in the course of his career, but he tended to regard nebulae as star systems in the process of evolution toward denser states, with the evolution driven by universal
     <xref articleid="106265">
      gravitation
     </xref>
     . Today it is known that “nebulae” come in several kinds: some are clouds of glowing gas; some are
     <xref articleid="110473">
      clusters of stars
     </xref>
     ; and some really are
     <xref articleid="110642">
      galaxies
     </xref>
     comparable in size to the Milky Way. But this understanding was not possible until the 19th-century development of

     and the 20th-century measurement of the distance to another galaxy.

     Herschel was unusual among the astronomers of his day, because he concerned himself with the larger construction of the heavens and was far less interested in the ordinary business of professional astronomy, which meant making exactingly accurate position measurements. Herschel helped to open the road to a new physical astronomy that really came into its own only in the 20th century. Nevertheless, there were important discoveries to be made with the old style of astronomy, conducted at universities or sponsored by national observatories, ostensibly because of its application to

    <p>
     English astronomer
     <xref articleid="16120">
      James Bradley
     </xref>
     was perhaps the most significant of the old-style 18th-century observers. High-precision measurements of star positions that he made in the 1720s led him to the discovery of the
     <xref articleid="3334">
      aberration of starlight
     </xref>
     . It had been known since the late 17th century that
     <xref articleid="110443">
      light
     </xref>
     has a finite speed. Danish astronomer
     <xref articleid="83854">
      Ole Rømer
     </xref>
     used that idea in 1676 to explain why the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter appear to run alternately about 10 minutes ahead of or behind schedule over the course of a year. Christiaan Huygens then worked out a numerical estimate for the speed of light that was published in his
     <e type="italic">
      Traité de la Lumière
     </e>
     (
     <e type="italic">
      Treatise on Light
     </e>
     , 1690). Bradley discovered that the fixed stars too suffer apparent annual changes in their positions. For example, a star near the pole of the
     <xref articleid="31918">
      ecliptic
     </xref>
     (seen at right angles to the plane of Earth’s orbit) appears to execute a small circular motion, of 20 seconds of arc radius, in the course of a year. A second discovery by Bradley introduced an even more troublesome complication—the
     <xref articleid="56545">
      nutation
     </xref>
     (or nodding) of Earth’s axis, which has an amplitude of about 8 seconds. Because of aberration and nutation, the fullest possible precision of astronomical observations could not be achieved unless the observations were corrected for these effects.

     of the triple star
     <xref articleid="5888">

     in 1838. The annual parallax is the tiny back-and-forth shift in the direction of a relatively nearby star, with respect to more-distant background stars, caused by the fact that
     <xref articleid="110147">
      Earth
     </xref>
     changes its vantage point over the course of a year. Since the acceptance of
     <xref articleid="105759">
      Copernicus
     </xref>
     ’s moving Earth, astronomers had known that stellar parallax must exist. But the effect is so small (because the diameter of Earth’s
     <xref articleid="57286">
      orbit
     </xref>
     is tiny compared with the distance of even the nearest stars) that it had resisted all efforts at detection. For example, the parallax of 61 Cygni is 0.287 seconds of arc (1 second of arc = 1/3,600 of a degree). The shift from parallax was observed only after the development of precise astronomical instruments, such as the
     <xref articleid="488030">

     that German physicist and optician

     built for Bessel, that could measure stellar positions to the necessary accuracy of hundredths of a second of arc. (In the preceding century Bradley, who could measure stellar positions only with an accuracy of half a second of arc, had been making a failed attempt to detect stellar parallax when he stumbled instead on the aberration of light.) The successful measurement of stellar parallaxes gave for the first time accurate values for the distances of stars other than the

A star’s spectrum is continuous, with all the colours present, though it may be brighter in one or another part of the spectrum according to the temperature of the star. (Cooler stars are redder.) Typically, the continuous spectrum is also overlaid with a number of dark absorption lines. Secchi’s classification scheme was based on the overall colour of the star, the number and kind of absorption lines, and other features of the spectrum. This work, performed before the application of photography to spectroscopy, was slow and very tedious.

    The cataloging of stellar spectra opened the way for new discoveries, for it soon became clear that the spectral type of a
    <xref articleid="110472">
     star
    </xref>
    has a relation to the star’s intrinsic brightness. However, since a star will look dimmer the farther away it is, the intrinsic brightness (or absolute
    <xref articleid="50048">
     magnitude
    </xref>
    ) of a star cannot be known unless one first has a way to determine the distance. American astronomer
    <xref articleid="64468">
     Henry Norris Russell
    </xref>
    in 1913 published a scatter plot correlating absolute magnitude with spectral type, using only stars for which he judged that the distances had been well determined. Slightly earlier, German astronomer Hans Rosenberg and Danish astronomer
    <xref articleid="40258">
     Ejnar Hertzsprung
    </xref>
    had plotted similar diagrams, using only stars from a single
    <xref articleid="110473">

    </xref>
    , either the
    <xref articleid="60393">

    or the
    <xref articleid="41679">

    . (Stars in a single cluster are all at roughly the same distance from
    <xref articleid="110147">
     Earth
    </xref>
    , so their apparent magnitudes can be used as replacements for their absolute magnitudes.) The resulting scatter plots are called
    <xref articleid="40259">
     Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagrams
    </xref>
    . The H-R diagram revealed that most stars lie on a “main sequence,” in which absolute magnitude is positively correlated with temperature. Bluer main-sequence stars (spectral type O or B) are much brighter than main-sequence red stars (spectral type K or M). The H-R diagram also showed a second branch, in which there are reddish stars that are much brighter than those on the main sequence. If these bright red stars have the same surface temperature (because they are of the same spectral type) as a main-sequence star but are much brighter, they must be physically larger, and they soon came to be called “red giants.”
    <xref articleid="76822">
     White dwarfs

    were soon discovered as yet another branch. The H-R diagram became crucial for guiding speculations about the evolution of stars.

    <xref articleid="106465">

    (Lord Kelvin) pointed out that a chemical process could hardly last more than 3,000 years. In various versions of heating by release of gravitational energy, the Sun was supposed to be contracting slowly (by about 75 metres [246 feet] per year) or else be heated by the continual infall of
    <xref articleid="110158">

    in the 1890s and the realization that Earth’s interior was warmed by this mechanism, various schemes were proposed for explaining stellar energy in terms of radioactive decay. The true explanation came only after German American physicist

    ). In the 1920s English astrophysicist
    <xref articleid="31962">

    proposed the
    <xref articleid="61627">

    are combined to produce one atom of
    <xref articleid="1713">
     helium
    </xref>
    , with the mass difference released in the form of energy. Because of the primitive state of nuclear physics at the time, he could not say in detail how this might occur, but he pointed to the mere existence of helium in the stars as the surest proof that such a process must exist. Nuclear physics gained a firm foundation in the early 1930s with the discovery of the
    <xref articleid="55406">
     neutron
    </xref>
    and of
    <xref articleid="30119">

    and a neutron in its

    ). From then on, progress was rapid. In 1937 German physicist
    <xref articleid="438066">

    discovered the

    act as catalysts in a sequence of
    <xref articleid="56446">

    that leads to the conversion of hydrogen into helium. In 1939 German American physicist
    <xref articleid="78964">
     Hans Bethe
    </xref>
    published a more detailed and quantitative study of the CNO cycle that finally put stellar astrophysics on a secure footing. Bethe also treated in detail the proton-proton reaction that Eddington had only guessed at. In a collision at high temperature, two protons may stay close enough together for the brief time required for one of them to be converted into a neutron by emission of a positron; thus, deuterium is formed. From deuterium, helium may then be built up in several different ways. Bethe also showed that the CNO cycle is more important in high-temperature stars and the proton-proton reaction more important in cooler stars. Nuclear physics was successfully integrated with what was known about the conditions of temperature and density in the interiors of stars.

     A key theoretical development for 20th-century astronomy and cosmology was the development of the theory of
     <xref articleid="109465">
      relativity
     </xref>
     , from 1905 to 1915, which eventually led to an explanation of the origin of the universe. The theory of relativity grew out of contradictions between
     <xref articleid="106021">
      electromagnetic
     </xref>
     theory (worked out by Scottish physicist
     <xref articleid="108468">
      James Clerk Maxwell
     </xref>
     in the 1860s) and what people thought they knew about relativity of motion. As a high-school student,
     <xref articleid="106018">
      Albert Einstein
     </xref>
     formulated a clever thought experiment and reasoned to a contradiction. According to electromagnetic theory, a
     <xref articleid="110443">
      light
     </xref>
     wave consists of changing
     <xref articleid="32278">
      electric
     </xref>
     and
     <xref articleid="50022">
      magnetic fields
     </xref>
     . Einstein asked what one would see if one could run at the speed of light alongside a light wave. In the frame of reference of the runner, the light wave would be stationary. Hence its fields would not be changing, and consequently the light wave should not exist. Clearly, something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were also experimental difficulties. At the close of the 19th century, it was widely believed that light needs a medium to propagate in (as do other
     <xref articleid="473598">
      wave
     </xref>
     disturbances, such as
     <xref articleid="109557">
      sound
     </xref>
     ). This all-pervading medium was given a name, the luminiferous (or light-carrying)
     <xref articleid="33121">
      ether
     </xref>
     . However, several experiments, including the famous
     <xref articleid="52479">
      Michelson-Morley experiment
     </xref>
     of 1887, failed to detect any motion of
     <xref articleid="110147">
      Earth
     </xref>
     with respect to the ether. Many physicists regarded this as a crisis, and some sought rather desperate ways out. Irish physicist
     <xref articleid="34429">
      George Francis FitzGerald
     </xref>
     proposed in 1889 that a moving body, owing to its interaction with the ether, undergoes a contraction in the direction of its motion in just the right amount to explain the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. A similar idea was worked out in greater detail by the Dutch physicist

     Einstein’s approach was far more fundamental. In his 1905 paper “Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper” (“On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”), he proceeded axiomatically. He assumed, first, that all uniformly moving reference frames are equally valid for doing physics and, second, that the
     <xref articleid="471069">
      speed of light
     </xref>
     is always the same, regardless of the relative motion of the source and the receiver. The first postulate was unexceptional; it was a logical result of the scientific revolution from
     <xref articleid="105759">
      Copernicus
     </xref>
     to
     <xref articleid="105766">
      Galileo
     </xref>
     . The second postulate was unusual (and one can note how it resolves the paradox of the young Einstein: one simply cannot run alongside a light wave so that it appears stationary). From these two postulates, surprising consequences followed:
     <xref articleid="72511">
      time runs at different rates
     </xref>
     in different frames of reference;
     <xref articleid="48965">
      lengths are contracted
     </xref>
     in the direction of motion (not, as Lorentz and FitzGerald thought, owing to an interaction with the ether but rather owing to the very nature of space and time); and finally, the mass of a moving body increases without limit as the body’s speed approaches that of light. All this is a part of the special theory of relativity (special because
     <xref articleid="106265">
      gravity
     </xref>
     is not included and only uniformly moving bodies are considered).
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of the same equations had been obtained earlier by Lorentz. In France too mathematician
     <xref articleid="60534">
      Henri Poincaré
     </xref>
     was tapping at the door. Relativity was in the air in 1905, and if Einstein had not written his paper, the same basic results would have been obtained. Einstein’s merit was his clarity of thought and his axiomatic approach, which showed that something fundamental was at stake. The ether simply had no place in his worldview. Shortly afterward Einstein’s former teacher mathematician
     <xref articleid="52860">
      Hermann Minkowski
     </xref>
     formulated the notion of
     <xref articleid="68970">
      space-time
     </xref>
     , in which time is regarded as a fourth dimension. This did not change the equations of relativity theory, but it greatly changed the way people thought about the theory and it helped prepare the way for the general theory.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the special theory of relativity was bound to happen, the same cannot be said of the
     <xref articleid="109465" refid="h252889">
      general theory of relativity
     </xref>
     , which is a theory of the gravitational field. Einstein turned to the problem of
     <xref articleid="106265">
      gravitation
     </xref>
     shortly after publishing his special theory. By 1907 he had already become convinced that a gravitational field should deflect a ray of light. In developing his new theory, he was guided by two considerations. The first was the principle of equivalence—that acceleration and gravitation are somehow manifestations of the same thing. For example, as Einstein put it, a freely falling man would not feel his own weight. The second consideration was general covariance—namely, the assumption that the laws of physics should take the same mathematical forms in arbitrary frames of reference and not just in uniformly moving frames. The mathematics was difficult, and after years of groping, in 1915 Einstein found the general theory of relativity.

However, the other planets weakly attract Mercury and disturb its orbit so that the long axis of Mercury’s orbital ellipse is not stationary but rotates around the Sun. The point of the orbit where Mercury is closest to the Sun is called the perihelion; thus, the perihelion slowly advances, in the same direction that Mercury moves.

     Before he published his new theory, Einstein checked that it gave the right answer for the Mercury problem. In the theory of general relativity,

     , in which the gravitational force between two bodies decreases with the inverse square of the distance between them, is not completely accurate in describing massive bodies that are very near each other; rather, the law must be modified by a term that decreases with the inverse fourth power of the distance. The mass of the Sun is not very great, and no planets, aside from Mercury, move very near it; thus, in describing the solar system, Newton’s law of gravity had been quite a successful approximation.

     A second prediction of Einstein’s gravity theory was a value for the bending of a ray of starlight as it passes by the Sun. Here Einstein had a bit of luck. In a preliminary version of the theory, the bending came out too small by half. Einstein had tried to get astronomers interested in detecting the bending by looking for apparent shifts in the locations of stars near the Sun during a total solar

     The third effect of general relativity predicted by Einstein was the gravitational redshift. Light coming from a compact massive object should be slightly

     </xref>
     ; that is, the light should have a longer wavelength. Measuring this was a delicate business, as the expected shift was small and could easily be masked by other effects. Attempts to measure the gravitational redshift by using absorption lines in the solar spectrum led to contradictory and inconclusive results, but in 1925 American astronomer

     <xref articleid="76822">

     were expected to have much higher gravitational redshifts than stars like the Sun.) The confirmation of the gravitational redshift not only bolstered general relativity but also helped support Eddington’s theory of stellar structure, which predicted enormous densities (and therefore very strong surface gravities) for white dwarfs. It was not realized until decades later that Adams’s measurement of the gravitational redshift of Sirius B was too small by a factor of four. Compensating errors in Adams’s measurements and in Eddington’s ideas of the temperature and radius of Sirius B had produced a fortuitous agreement (Sirius B is even smaller than Eddington thought). This was another case of Einstein’s being lucky, for a conflict between the measured redshift and the theoretical value could again have compromised the acceptance of general relativity. In the case of Adams’s measurements, a major source of trouble was light from Sirius itself scattered into the Sirius B spectrum by Adams’s instruments. However, by then the effect had been successfully measured in laboratories on Earth with just the value that Einstein’s theory predicts.

    as a whole, publishing his first cosmological paper in 1917. Because he was not well acquainted with recent work in astronomy, he assumed that the universe was static and unchanging. Einstein assumed that matter was distributed uniformly throughout the universe, but he could not find a static solution to his field equations. The problem was that the mutual gravitation of all the matter in the universe would tend to make the universe contract. Therefore, Einstein introduced an additional term containing a factor Λ, the “cosmological constant.” The new term provided a universal cosmic repulsive force, which could act at great distances to counteract the effects of gravity. When he later learned of the expansion of the universe, Einstein described the cosmological constant as the greatest blunder of his career. (But the cosmological constant has crept back into late 20th-century and 21st-century cosmology. Even when Einstein was wrong, he was often onto something profound.)

    Einstein’s static solution represented a universe of finite volume but with no edges, as space curved back on itself. Thus, an imaginary traveler could travel forever in a straight line and never come to an edge of the universe. The space has positive curvature, so the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180°, though the excess would be apparent only in triangles of sufficient size. (A good two-dimensional analogy is

    At the beginning of the 20th century, most professional astronomers still believed that the
    <xref articleid="110643">
     Milky Way
    </xref>
    was essentially the same thing as the visible universe. A minority believed in a theory of island universes—that the spiral nebulae are enormous star systems, comparable to the Milky Way, and are scattered through space with vast empty distances between them. One objection to the island-universe theory was that very few spirals are seen near the plane of the Milky Way, the so-called Zone of Avoidance. Thus, the spirals must somehow be a part of the Milky Way system. But American astronomer Heber Curtis pointed out that some spirals that can be viewed edge-on obviously contain huge amounts of dust in their “equatorial” planes. One might also expect the Milky Way to have large amounts of dust throughout its plane, which would explain why many dim spirals cannot be seen there; visibility is simply obscured at low galactic latitudes. In 1917 Curtis also found three
    <xref articleid="56362">

    on his photographs of spirals; the faintness of these novae implied that the spirals were at great distances from the Milky Way.

     Vesto M. Slipher

    had begun to measure the radial velocities of spiral nebulae. The first spiral that Slipher examined was the
    <xref articleid="7505">

    </xref>
    , which turned out to be blueshifted—that is, moving toward the Milky Way—with a velocity of approach of 300 km (200 miles) per second, the greatest velocity ever measured for any celestial object up to that time. By 1917 Slipher had radial velocities for 25 spirals, some as high as 1,000 km (600 miles) per second. Objects moving at such speeds could hardly belong to the Milky Way. Although a few were blueshifted, the overwhelming majority were
    <xref articleid="62957">
     redshifted
    </xref>
    , corresponding to motion away from the Milky Way. Astronomers did not, however, immediately conclude that the universe is expanding. Rather, because Slipher’s spirals were not uniformly distributed around the sky, astronomers used the data to try to deduce the velocity of the Sun with respect to the system of spirals. The majority of Slipher’s spirals were on one side of the Milky Way and receding, whereas a few were on the other side and approaching. For Slipher, the Milky Way was itself a spiral, moving with respect to a greater field of spirals.

    In 1917 Dutch mathematician
    <xref articleid="68024">
     Willem de Sitter
    </xref>
    found another apparently static cosmological solution of the field equations, different from Einstein’s, that showed a correlation between distance and redshift. Although it was not clear that de Sitter’s solution could describe the universe, as it was devoid of matter, this did motivate astronomers to look for a relationship between distance and redshift. In 1924 Swedish astronomer Karl Lundmark published an empirical study that gave a roughly linear relation (though with lots of scatter) between the distances and velocities of the spirals. The difficulty was in knowing the distances accurately enough. Lundmark used novae that had been observed in the Andromeda Nebula to establish the distance of that nebula by assuming that these novae would have the same average absolute brightness as novae in the Milky Way whose distances were approximately known. For more-distant spirals, Lundmark invoked the crude assumptions that those spirals had to have the same diameter and brightness as the Andromeda Nebula. Thus, the novae functioned as standard candles (that is, objects with a defined brightness), and for more-distant spirals, the spirals themselves became the standard candle.

    studied nonstatic cosmological solutions to Einstein’s equations. These went beyond Einstein’s model by allowing expansion or contraction of the universe and beyond de Sitter’s model by allowing the universe to contain matter. Friedmann also introduced cosmological models with negative curvature. (In a negatively curved space, the angles of a triangle add up to less than 180°.) Friedmann’s solutions had little immediate impact, partly because of his early death in 1925 and partly because he had not connected his theoretical work with astronomical observations. It did not help that Einstein published a note claiming that Friedmann’s 1922 paper contained a fundamental error; Einstein later withdrew this criticism.

     In 1929, building on Friedmann’s work, American mathematician and physicist Howard P. Robertson summarized the most general space-time metric that is possible under the assumption that the universe is homogeneous (of the same density everywhere) and isotropic (the same in all spatial directions). (A metric is a generalization of the

The Cepheids vary in brightness in a regular and easily identifiable way, with a quick increase in brightness followed by a slower decline. In 1908 American astronomer
     <xref articleid="47538">
      Henrietta Leavitt
     </xref>
     had found a relationship between the period and the brightness: the brighter the Cepheid, the longer its period.

     and American astronomer
     <xref articleid="67144">

     went on to calibrate the relationship in terms of absolute
     <xref articleid="50048">
      magnitudes
     </xref>
     . Hubble could easily measure the Cepheid’s period. He could then use the calibration curve to determine the star’s absolute magnitude, or intrinsic brightness, and the intrinsic brightness compared with the observed brightness gave the distance of the star. This measurement established beyond question that the Andromeda Nebula is outside the Milky Way and is a
     <xref articleid="110642">
      galaxy
     </xref>
     in its own right. Further work by Hubble with Cepheid variables in other spiral nebulae confirmed the island-universe theory.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Hubble turned to the problem of the distance-redshift relationship, he soon superseded Slipher’s work. In 1929 Hubble published a paper showing a clear linear relationship between distance and redshift, which he interpreted as a velocity. He used Slipher’s velocities but added more that had been measured at Mount Wilson by American astronomer Milton Humason. Distances of the nearer nebulae were found by using Cepheids as standard candles. At greater distances Hubble used as a standard candle the brightest individual stars that could be resolved (assuming that these would be of the same brightness in all
     <xref articleid="110642">
      galaxies
     </xref>
     ), and at greater distances yet, the luminosities of the nebulae themselves were the standard candle. Hubble’s paper led to a rapid acceptance of the distance-redshift (or distance-velocity) relation in the astronomical community, and this relationship is known as “Hubble’s law,” although, as discussed above, it had been several times anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hubble himself was quite cautious about what the distance-velocity relationship implied about the history of the universe, but the natural conclusion to draw was that in the remote past all the galaxies had been close together. The distance-velocity relationship being linear, if galaxy B was 10 times farther away than galaxy A, it would be receding at 10 times the speed. By the same token, if the galactic clock was run backward to the beginning, both A and B would be at the same point (galaxy B retracing the greater distance at greater speed). Hubble’s value for the slope of the line in the velocity-versus-distance graph (today known as the
     <xref articleid="41369">
      Hubble constant
     </xref>
     ) was 500 km (300 miles) per second per million
     <xref articleid="58565">
      parsecs
     </xref>
     (megaparsec). (A parsec is about 3.26 light-years and is the distance at which the radius of Earth’s orbit would subtend an angle of one second.) With this value for the Hubble constant, the universe appeared to be about two billion years old.
    </p>
    <p>
     Subsequent studies indicated that this estimate was far too young. The study of radioactive
     <xref articleid="110412">

     in rocks suggested that
     <xref articleid="110147">
      Earth
     </xref>
     had to be 4.5 billion years old, which would make the universe younger than some of the objects in it. The value of the Hubble constant has been revised repeatedly. A major correction was made in 1952 when American astronomer Walter Baade discovered that Hubble had seriously underestimated galactic distances, because there are actually two different kinds of Cepheids. Baade’s recalibration resulted in a halving of the Hubble constant. A further major correction by American astronomer
     <xref articleid="65448">
      Allan Sandage
     </xref>
     in 1958 brought it down to about 100 km (60 miles) per second per megaparsec. Sandage, who was Hubble’s former observing assistant, showed that what Hubble had taken as the brightest individual stars in a galaxy were actually tight

     </xref>
     of bright stars embedded in gaseous
     <xref articleid="108754">
      nebulae
     </xref>
     . For several decades the value of the constant was (according to different researchers) in the range 50–100 km (80–160 miles) per second per megaparsec. The currently accepted value for Hubble’s constant is around 71 km (44 miles) per second per megaparsec, with a margin of error of about 5 percent. The associated age of the universe, tightly constrained by many types of observations, is about 13.7 billion years.

     proposed that

     <xref articleid="25044">

     </xref>
     , leading to a progressive reddening of the light. Others simply suggested various versions of the reddening of light with distance (collectively these were called the “tired light” hypothesis) without attempting to provide a physical explanation. These proposals never commanded a wide following, and during the 1930s astronomers and cosmologists increasingly embraced the expansion of the universe.

     The general-relativistic cosmological models and the observed expansion of the universe suggest that the universe was once very small. In the 1930s astronomers began to explore evolutionary models of the universe, a good example being Georges Lemaître’s primeval atom. According to Lemaître, the universe began as a single
     <xref articleid="110411">
      atom
     </xref>
     having an
     <xref articleid="10135">
      atomic weight
     </xref>
     equal to the entire mass of the universe, which then decayed by a super-radiative process until atoms of ordinary atomic weight emerged.

     A pioneering study of elemental abundances in the stars had been made by British-born American astronomer
     <xref articleid="543597">
      Cecilia Payne
     </xref>
     in her doctoral thesis of 1925. The amount of each element present in a star can be inferred from the strengths of the absorption lines in the star’s spectrum, if these are controlled for the temperature and pressure of the star. One fact that emerged early on was that stars did not have the same composition as Earth and were predominantly

      hydrogen
     </xref>
     and
     <xref articleid="1713">
      helium
     </xref>
     . In 1938 Norwegian mineralogist
     <xref articleid="37278">

     published a detailed summary of data on cosmic abundances of the elements, running over most of the periodic table.

     </xref>
     ” theory, it was a paper of 1948 by American physicist Ralph Alpher and his dissertation supervisor,
     <xref articleid="35977">
      George Gamow
     </xref>
     , that changed the direction of research by putting nuclear physics into cosmology. As a joke, Gamow added the name of physicist
     <xref articleid="78964">
      Hans Bethe
     </xref>
     in order to preserve the Alpher-Bethe-Gamow sequence of (almost) Greek letters. In the aßγ paper, which was only one page long, Alpher and Gamow maintained that the formation of the elements (
     <xref articleid="56459">
      nucleosynthesis
     </xref>
     ) began about 20 seconds after the start of the expansion of the universe. They supposed that the universe began with a hot dense gas of
     <xref articleid="55406">
      neutrons
     </xref>
     , which started to decay into
     <xref articleid="61626">
      protons
     </xref>
     and
     <xref articleid="32316">
      electrons
     </xref>
     . The building up of the elements was due to successive neutron capture (and readjustments of charge by
     <xref articleid="78953">
      ß-decay
     </xref>
     ). Using recently published values for the neutron-capture cross-sections of the elements, they integrated their equations to produce a graph of the abundances of all the elements, which resulted in a smooth-curve approximation to the jagged abundance curve that had been published by Goldschmidt.
    </p>
    <p>
     In another paper in 1948, Alpher and American physicist Robert Herman argued that electromagnetic radiation from the early universe should still exist, but with the expansion it should now correspond to a temperature of about 5 K (kelvins, or −268 °C [−451 °F]) and thus would be visible to radio telescopes. In a 1953 paper, Alpher, Herman, and American physicist James Follin provided a stage-by-stage history of the early universe, concluding that nucleosynthesis was essentially complete after 30 minutes of cosmic expansion. They deduced that if all the neutrons available at the end of nucleosynthesis went into making helium only, the present-day hydrogen-to-helium ratio would be between 7:1 and 10:1 in terms of numbers of atoms. This would correspond to a present-day universe that was between 29 and 36 percent helium by weight. (Because some neutrons would go into building other elements, the helium figures would be upper limits.) They pointed out that these figures were of the same order as the hydrogen-to-helium ratios measured in
     <xref articleid="60301">
      planetary nebulae
     </xref>
     and stellar atmospheres, though these showed quite a large range.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Gamow-Alpher theory largely ceased development after 1953, and it failed to attract a following, in spite of the fact that they had published in highly prominent journals and had made detailed, testable predictions. Unfortunately, it was not until the 1960s that the hydrogen-to-helium ratio became known precisely enough to test the theory. More crucially, Alpher and Gamow failed to interest radio astronomers in looking for the 5-K background radiation, and their prediction was soon forgotten.

     In England, also in 1948, an alternative theory emerged called the
     <xref articleid="69502">
      steady-state
     </xref>
     universe. Different versions of it were proposed by English mathematician and astronomer
     <xref articleid="41260">
      Fred Hoyle
     </xref>
     and by the team of British mathematician and cosmologist
     <xref articleid="80576">
      Hermann Bondi
     </xref>
     and British astronomer Thomas Gold, but the key idea was that although the universe was expanding, its average properties did not change with time. As the universe expanded, the density of matter would be expected to diminish, but new hydrogen atoms were created that formed clouds of gas that condensed into new stars and galaxies. The number of new hydrogen atoms required per year was so tiny that one could not hope to observe this process directly. However, there were predictable observational consequences that should allow one to distinguish between a steady-state universe or a
     <xref articleid="79147">
      big-bang
     </xref>
     universe. (The term
     <e type="italic">
      big bang
     </e>
     was coined by Hoyle as a mildly pejorative characterization of the rival theory in a radio talk in 1949.)
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, in a big-bang universe, when one looks at galaxies that are far away, one also sees them as they were in the remote past (because of the travel time of the light). Thus, one might expect that distant galaxies are less-evolved or that they contain more young stars. But in a steady-state universe, one would see galaxies at all possible stages of evolutionary development at even the farthest distances. The density of galaxies in space should also diminish with time in a big-bang universe. Therefore, galaxies at great distances should be more densely crowded together than nearby galaxies are. But in a steady-state universe, the average density of galaxies should be about the same everywhere and at every time. In the 1950s the Cambridge radio astronomer
     <xref articleid="64560">
      Martin Ryle
     </xref>
     showed that there were more radio galaxies at great distances than there were nearby, thus showing that the universe had evolved over time, a result that could not be explained in steady-state theory.
    </p>
    <p>
     The discovery of
     <xref articleid="62185">
      quasars
     </xref>
     (quasi-stellar radio sources) in the early 1960s also told heavily against the steady-state theory. Quasars were first identified as strong radio sources that in visible light appear to be identified with small starlike objects. Further, they have large
     <xref articleid="62957">
      redshifts
     </xref>
     , which implies that they are very far away. From their distance and their apparent luminosity, it was inferred that they emit copious amounts of energy; a single quasar might be brighter than a whole galaxy. There was no room for such objects in a steady-state universe, in which the contents of any region of space (seen as it is now or as it was long ago) should be roughly similar. The quasars were a clear sign that the universe was evolving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Steady-state theory never had a large following, and its supporters were centred in Britain. Nevertheless, having a competing theory forced the big-bang cosmologists to strengthen their arguments and to collect supporting data. A key question centred on the abundances and origins of the
     <xref articleid="110602">
      chemical elements
     </xref>
     . In steady-state theory, it was essential that all the elements could be synthesized in stars. By contrast, in the aßγ paper, Alpher and Gamow tried to show that all the elements could be made in the big bang. Of course, in a more reasonable view, big-bang theorists had to accept that some element formation does take place in stars, but they were keen to show that the stars could not account for all of it. In particular, the stars could not be the source of most of the light elements. For example, it was impossible to see how during the lifetime of a galaxy the stars could build up the helium content to 30 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
     One obstacle for big-bang theory was the absence of any stable isotopes at
     <xref articleid="10130">
      atomic mass
     </xref>
     5 or 8. In 1952 Austrian-born American astrophysicist
     <xref articleid="473851">
      Edwin Salpeter
     </xref>
     proposed that three
     <xref articleid="5891">
      alpha particles
     </xref>
     (helium nuclei) can come together to produce carbon-12 and that this happens often enough to resolve the mass-gap problem in the interiors of stars. However, conditions in the early universe were not right for bridging the mass gap in this way, so the mass-gap problem was seen as favouring steady-state theory. Hoyle adopted Salpeter’s proposal in 1953. In 1957 Hoyle, with American astronomers
     <xref articleid="35057">
      William Fowler
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref articleid="18118">

     </xref>
     (or B
     <sup>
      2
     </sup>
     FH, as their paper was later called), gave an impressive and detailed account of the abundances of most elements in terms of conditions appropriate to stellar interiors. Although the B
     <sup>
      2
     </sup>
     FH paper was not explicitly a steady-state theory, it was often seen as favouring that model, as it had not made use of temperature and pressure conditions appropriate to the big bang. But in papers of 1964 (with English astrophysicist Roger Tayler) and 1967 (with Fowler and American physicist Robert Wagoner), Hoyle concluded that the lighter elements could be built up satisfactorily only in conditions like those of the big bang. Hoyle himself continued to favour supermassive objects as the origin of the elements over the big bang, but most astronomers saw this work as vindicating big-bang theory. In defending a failed cosmological theory, Hoyle had done an enormous amount of good work of lasting value on nucleosynthesis.

     When good estimates of the cosmic abundance of
     <xref articleid="30119">
      deuterium
     </xref>
     and other light elements became available, big-bang theory proved capable of detailed explanation of the cosmic abundances of all the light elements. In current scenarios, hydrogen (H) and its heavier isotope, deuterium (
     <sup>

     H), most of the two helium isotopes (

Given whatever one assumes about the present-day density of matter in the universe, one can calculate what sort of cosmic abundances should have resulted from the big bang. It is regarded as a triumph of the big-bang model that the present-day abundances of these elements can all be explained from one set of initial conditions. According to current thinking, most of the heavier elements were then built up in stars,

     , with the goal of applying the technology to
     <xref articleid="472079">
      communications satellites
     </xref>
     , but Penzias and Wilson had adapted it for doing radio astronomy. They detected a constant, persistent signal, corresponding to an excess temperature of 3.3 K (−269.9 °C [−453.7 °F]). After eliminating every source of circuit noise they could think of, and even shooing a pair of
     <xref articleid="59990">

     </xref>
     that had been roosting (and leaving behind “white dielectric material”) in the horn, they found that the signal remained and that it was constant, no matter in which direction the telescope was pointed. At nearby
     <xref articleid="61415">
      Princeton University
     </xref>
     , they consulted with American physicist Robert Dicke, who was studying oscillatory models of the universe with hot phases and who was therefore not surprised by what they had found. About the same time, astrophysicist James Peebles, Dicke’s former student, also published a paper predicting the existence of a universal background radiation at a temperature of 10 K (−263 °C [−441 °F]), apparently completely unaware of Alpher and Herman’s earlier prediction. Suddenly the pieces fell together. The
     <xref articleid="471314">
      cosmic microwave background
     </xref>
     (CMB) was accepted as the third major piece of evidence in support of the big-bang theory. In the early stages of the expansion, when atoms were all still completely ionized, the universe was opaque to
     <xref articleid="106022">
      electromagnetic radiation
     </xref>
     . But when the universe cooled enough to allow the formation of neutral
     <xref articleid="110411">
      atoms
     </xref>
     , it suddenly became transparent to electromagnetic radiation (just as light can travel through air). At this “decoupling time,” the electromagnetic radiation was of very high energy and very short wavelengths. With the continued expansion of space, wavelengths were stretched until they reached their current
     <xref articleid="52523">
      microwave
     </xref>
     lengths (from about a millimetre to tens of centimetres in wavelength). Thus, every bit of empty space acts as a source of radio waves—a phenomenon predicted (twice!) by big-bang theory but for which steady-state theory had no ready explanation. For most cosmologists, this marked the end of the steady-state theory, even though Hoyle and his collaborators continued to tweak and adjust the theory to try to meet objections.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the mid-1960s, big-bang theory had become the standard cosmology, underpinned by the observed expansion, the measured abundances of the light elements, and the presence of the cosmic microwave background. Of course, the theory was eventually to acquire many different forms and refinements.

     Over the course of the 20th century, it became clear that there is much more to the universe than meets the eye. On the basis of early estimates of the mass density of the
     <xref articleid="110643">
      Milky Way
     </xref>
     , English physicist and mathematician
     <xref articleid="43471">
      James Jeans
     </xref>
     suggested in 1922 that the galaxy might contain three times as many dark stars as visible ones. In 1933 Fritz Zwicky, by studying the dynamics of
     <xref articleid="472054">
      clusters of galaxies
     </xref>
     , concluded that there is not enough visible matter in the galaxies to hold the clusters together gravitationally. He also pointed out that the measured quantity of luminous matter was far below the value that would be necessary for critical density—i.e., to produce a universe with an expansion that would gradually slow to a halt at infinity—but he speculated that the
     <xref articleid="471078">
      dark matter
     </xref>
     could conceivably be enough to make up the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jeans’s and Zwicky’s comments did not attract a lot of attention, and dark matter became a central issue only in the 1970s. In 1974 Peebles, Jeremiah Ostriker, and Amos Yahil in the United States and Jaan Einasto, Ants Kaasik, and Enn Saar in Soviet Estonia concluded, on the basis of studies of galactic dynamics, that 90–95 percent of the universe must be in the form of dark matter. American astronomer Vera Rubin published a paper in 1978 studying the rotational velocities of
     <xref articleid="110472">
      stars
     </xref>
     in
     <xref articleid="110642">
      galaxies
     </xref>
     as a function of their distances from the galactic centre. Rotational velocities were found to be nearly constant over a fairly large radial distance, though predictions based on the distribution of visible matter implied that they would decrease with distance. Rubin’s discoveries were interpreted as evidence for the presence of substantial amounts of dark matter in the haloes around galaxies. About the same time,
     <xref articleid="62411">

     , using a spectral line of

     <xref articleid="111070">

     ) in its geometry, which implies that it is close to critical density. However, the

     <xref articleid="436259">

     </xref>
     in 1992, was COBE’s detection of small fluctuations in the temperature in different directions in space—variations as small as a few parts in 100,000—that correspond to density fluctuations in the early universe at the decoupling time, about 300,000 years after the big bang. This discovery came as a relief to cosmologists, because the earlier failure to detect fluctuations in the spectrum was starting to cause difficulties for theories of structure formation in the early universe.

     By far the most ambitious instrument put into Earth orbit was the
     <xref articleid="2410">
      Hubble Space Telescope
     </xref>
     (HST), launched in 1990. Shortly afterward it was discovered that a design flaw in the principal mirror greatly reduced the image quality, but this was fixed by compensating optical devices inserted on a subsequent service trip by astronauts to the telescope. Among the original missions of the HST were determining more accurate values of the Hubble constant and the deceleration parameter, with the goal of limiting the number of possible cosmological models. The deceleration parameter is a measure of the rate at which the expansion of the universe is slowing down as the universe expands against

     In the 1980s astronomers began to use Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. These are believed to come about in the following way. A
     <xref articleid="76822">
      white dwarf star
     </xref>
     in a binary orbit with a neighbour can slowly pull material off, gradually increasing its own mass. Ordinarily the mass of the white dwarf could not exceed the
     <xref articleid="22400">
      Chandrasekhar limit
     </xref>
     of about 1.4 solar masses, or it would collapse to form a
     <xref articleid="55410">
      neutron star
     </xref>
     . However, in the case of white dwarfs rich in
     <xref articleid="20244">
      carbon
     </xref>
     , with the slow accretion of material pulled from the neighbour, the core temperature rises until the nuclear ignition of carbon causes a runaway explosion. Because of the slow accretion and the mass limit, these
     <xref articleid="70402">
      supernovae
     </xref>
     are remarkably uniform in their brightness; moreover, because they are so bright, they can be seen at great distances. In short, the uniform and extreme brightness of Type Ia supernovae make them excellent standard candles.

     In the 1990s two groups used observations of Type Ia supernovae in distant
     <xref articleid="110642">
      galaxies
     </xref>
     to work out distances to those galaxies, and thus how the rate of the universe’s expansion changed over time, more precisely than ever before. The Supernova Cosmology Project, led by American physicist
     <xref articleid="571546">
      Saul Perlmutter

     , and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, directed by Australian astronomer

     <xref articleid="571547">
      Adam Riess
     </xref>
     , used observations taken with ground-based telescopes as well as with the HST. The result was most unexpected. Far from finding a better value for the deceleration parameter, after a period of confusion and contradiction, both groups found that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up. The direct observations were that distant supernovae appeared to be 20–25 percent dimmer than expected. The two teams ruled out such possibilities as dimming by dust, and their papers, published in 1998 and 1999, led to the same general conclusion. The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and that acceleration began only about five billion or six billion years ago.

     The consensus emerging from the Ia supernovae projects was that the geometry of the universe is essentially flat, and therefore quite close to the critical density, with matter making up only about 30 percent of the total energy density and “
     <xref articleid="471077">
      dark energy
     </xref>
     ” making up the remaining 70 percent. (Subsequent research has slightly modified these figures.) Although other possibilities are open, the dark energy is often identified with an Einsteinian cosmological constant that provides a universal repulsive force, which explains the acceleration. The nature of the dark energy is unknown. It may be connected with
     <xref articleid="110312">
      quantum-mechanical
     </xref>
     vacuum energy; however, there are serious unresolved difficulties with this possibility. Of the roughly 30 percent of the universe that is matter, only about 5 percent can be ordinary baryonic matter. Of this, only a small part is visible in the form of planets, stars, and galaxies.

     The objects of all astronomical inquiry, from the time of the ancient Greeks and Babylonians to the 20th century, thus represent only the tip of the iceberg. After almost 4,000 years of astronomy, the universe is no less strange than it must have seemed to the Babylonians.
