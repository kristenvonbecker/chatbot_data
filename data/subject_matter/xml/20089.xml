  (Latin: “hemp”). Hemp and flax fibre have been used for ages to produce cloth for sails. Certain classes are termed sailcloth or canvas synonymously. After the introduction of the power loom, canvas was made from flax, hemp, tow, jute, cotton, and mixtures of such fibres. Flax canvas is essentially of double warp, for it is invariably intended to withstand pressure or rough usage.

  Articles made from canvas include carrying devices for photographic and other apparatus; bags for fishing, shooting, golf, and other sporting equipment; shoes for games, running, and yachting; tents; and mailbags. Large quantities of flax and cotton canvases are tarred and used for covering goods on railways, wharves, and docks.

  Canvas yarns (usually cotton, flax, or jute) are almost invariably two or more ply, an arrangement that tends to produce a uniform thickness. A plain weave is extensively used for these fabrics, but in many cases special weaves are used that leave the open spaces well defined.

  Artists’ canvas, a single-warp variety, used for painting in oils, is much lighter than sail canvas. The best qualities are made of cream or bleached flax fibre about 25 cm (10 inches) long (line). An admixture of shorter linen fibre (tow), and even of cotton is found in the commoner kinds. When the cloth comes from the loom it is treated to prepare the surface for the paint.
