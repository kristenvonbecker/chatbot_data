  Rossby waves are formed when polar air moves toward the Equator while tropical air is moving poleward. Because of the
  <xref articleid="71632">
   temperature
  </xref>
  difference between the Equator and the poles due to differences in the amounts of
  <xref articleid="68564">

  received,

  tends to flow from low to high latitudes; this is accomplished, in part, by these air movements. Rossby waves are a dominant component of the Ferrel circulation. The tropical air carries heat poleward, and the polar air absorbs heat as it moves toward the Equator. The existence of these waves explains the low-pressure cells (

  ) and high-pressure cells (
  <xref articleid="7818">
   anticyclones
  </xref>
  ) that are important in producing the

  of the middle and higher latitudes.
