  (west), and is bordered by Pilot Butte (east). Laid out in 1904, the community grew after the Deschutes Irrigation and Power Company opened farmland for settlement in 1909. Vast timber resources influenced a railroad boom (1911), sawmills were built, and wood industries developed. Bend is now the headquarters for the Deschutes National Forest and is a centre for tourism because of its proximity to lakes, lava beds, caves, and mountain and ski resorts. Central Oregon Community College was established there in 1949. Newberry National Volcanic Monument, which includes the 6,200-foot- (1,890-metre-) long Lava River Cave, is 12.5 miles (20 km) south of the city. Inc. 1904. Pop. (2000) 52,029; Bend Metro Area, 115,367; (2010) 76,639; Bend Metro Area, 157,733.
