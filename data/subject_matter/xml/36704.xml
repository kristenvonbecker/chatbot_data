  , word game in which each player in turn presents a letter that must contribute to the eventual formation of a word but not complete it. The player whose letter completes a word loses the round and becomes one-third of a ghost. Three losses make a player a full ghost, putting him out of the game. Letters are usually spelled in the order presented, as
  <e type="italic">
   a
  </e>
  is added to
  <e type="italic">
   pl
  </e>
  to form
  <e type="italic">
   pla,
  </e>
  which may eventually become “placating.” In the variant game double ghosts, the player may specify whether his letter is to be attached before or after the preceding letters.

  A player may challenge his preceding opponent, and, if the opponent cannot name a word that could be developed from the combination of letters he has produced, he loses the round. If, however, he does name a valid word, the challenger is the loser.

  A similar game, played without the “ghost” terminology, is known as endbee.
