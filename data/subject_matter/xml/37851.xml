  <xref articleid="20130">
   Cape York Peninsula

  , Queensland. Within that state the ranges’ average elevation is 2,000–3,000 feet (600–900 metres), but they rise as high as 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) in the

  The headwaters of a number of Australia’s principal rivers are located in the Great Dividing Range. The

  The range was traversed in 1813 by Gregory Blaxland,
  <xref articleid="76557">

  , and William Lawson. This initial reconnaissance marked the beginning of European migration, previously inhibited by the highlands, from the east coast into the Australian interior, or outback. The region is now important for agriculture (grazing, mixed farming, fruit growing), lumbering, and mining. The rivers supply large irrigation and hydroelectric projects, while national parks and ski areas attract tourists. Especially popular is the
