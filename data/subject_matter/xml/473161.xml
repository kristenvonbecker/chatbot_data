  , Quotient of two values. The ratio of
  <e type="italic">
   a

  to
  <e type="italic">
   b
  </e>
  can be written
  <e type="italic">
   a
  </e>
  :
  <e type="italic">
   b
  </e>
  or as the fraction
  <e type="italic">
   a
  </e>
  /
  <e type="italic">
   b
  </e>
  . In either case,
  <e type="italic">
   a
  </e>
  is the antecedent and
  <e type="italic">
   b
  </e>
  the consequent. Ratios arise whenever comparisons are made. They are usually reduced to lowest terms for simplicity. Thus, a school with 1,000 students and 50 teachers has a student/teacher ratio of 20 to 1. The ratio of the width to the height of a rectangle is called an aspect ratio, an example of which is the
