  and those living in Islamic settings have created such an immense variety of literatures, performing arts, visual arts, and music that it virtually defies any comprehensive definition. In the narrowest sense, the arts of the Islamic peoples might be said to include only those arising directly from the practice of Islam. More commonly, however, the term is extended to include all of the arts produced by Muslim peoples, whether connected with their religion or not. In this article, the subject includes the arts created in pre-Islamic times by Arabs and other peoples in Asia Minor and North Africa who eventually adopted the Islamic faith. On the other hand, arts produced in cultural areas that were only partially Muslim are discussed primarily in articles on arts of those regions (

   General considerations
  </title>
  <p>
   It is difficult to establish a common denominator for all of the artistic expressions of the Islamic peoples. Such a common denominator would have to be meaningful for miniature painting and historiography, for a musical mode and the form of a poem. The relationship between the art of the Islamic peoples and its religious basis is anything but direct.

   Like most prophetic religions, Islam is not conducive to fine arts. Representation of living beings is prohibited—not in the
   <xref articleid="105854">
    Qurʾān
   </xref>
   but in the prophetic tradition. Thus, the centre of the Islamic artistic tradition lies in
   <xref articleid="110482" refid="h53194">
    calligraphy
   </xref>
   , a distinguishing feature of this culture, in which the word as the medium of divine revelation plays such an important role. Representational art was found, however, in some early palaces and “at the doors of the bathhouses,” according to later Persian poetry. After the 13th century a highly refined art of miniature developed, primarily in the non-Arab countries; it dwells, however, only rarely upon religious subjects. The typical expression of Muslim art is the
   <xref articleid="8148">
    arabesque
   </xref>
   , both in its geometric and in its organic form—one leaf, one flower growing out of the other, without beginning and end and capable of almost innumerable variations, only gradually detected by the eye, which never lose their charm. An aversion to empty spaces distinguishes that art; neither the tile-covered walls of a mosque nor the rich imagery of a poem allows an unembellished area, and the decoration of a carpet can be extended almost without limit.

   The centre of Islamic religion is the clean place for prayer, enlarged into the mosque, which comprises the community and all its needs. The essential structure is similar throughout the Muslim world. There are, of course, period and regional differences—large, wide court mosques of early times; the court mosques with big halls of Iran and adjacent countries; central buildings with the wonderfully shaped domes of the
   <xref articleid="111081">
    Ottoman Empire
   </xref>
   . The implements, however, are the same: a niche called a mihrab—pointing to
   <xref articleid="109828">
    Mecca
   </xref>
   —made of wood, marble, mosaic, stone, tiles; a small pulpit (
   <e type="italic">
    <xref articleid="52808">
     minbar
    </xref>
   </e>
   ) for the Friday sermon; minarets, locally differently shaped but always rising like the call to prayer that is uttered from their tops; the wooden carved stands for the Qurʾān, which is to be written in the most perfect form; sometimes highly artistic lamps (made in Syria and proverbially mentioned throughout the Muslim world); perhaps bronze candlesticks, with inlaid ornaments; and rich variations of the prayer mats. If any decoration was needed, it was the words of God, beautifully written or carved in the walls or around the domes. At first connected with the mosques and later independent of them are schools, mausoleums, rooms for the students, and cells for the religious masters.

   The poetry of the Arabs consisted in the beginning of praise and satirical poems thought to be full of magical qualities. The strict rules of the outward form of the poems (
   <xref articleid="125633">
    monorhyme
   </xref>
   , complicated metre) even in pre-Islamic times led to a certain formalism and encouraged imitation. Another early poetic form was the elegy, as noted in the work of the Arab female poet
   <xref articleid="45271">
    al-Khansāʾ
   </xref>
   (died after 630).
  </p>
  <p>
   For the most part, however, Goethe’s statement that the stories of
   <e type="italic">
    The Thousand and One Nights
   </e>
   have no goal in themselves shows his understanding of the character of Arabic belles lettres, contrasting them with the Islamic religion, which aims at “collecting and uniting people in order to achieve one high goal.” Poets, on the other hand, rove around without any ethical purpose, according to the Qurʾān. For many pious Muslims, poetry was something suspect, opposed to the divine law, especially since it sang mostly of forbidden wine and of free love. The combination of music and poetry, as practiced in court circles and among the mystics, has always aroused the wrath of the lawyer divines who wield so much authority in Islamic communities. This opposition may partly explain why Islamic poetry and fine arts took refuge in a kind of unreal world, using fixed images that could be correctly interpreted only by those who were knowledgeable in the art.

   The ambiguity of Persian poetry, which oscillates between the worldly, the divine, and often the political level, is typical of Islamic writings. Especially in Iran and the countries under its cultural influence, this kind of poetry formed the most important part of literature. Epic poetry of all kinds developed exclusively outside the Arabic-speaking countries; Western readers look in vain for an epical structure in such long poems (as in the case of the prose-romances of the Arabs) and find instead a rather aimless representation of facts and fictions. A similar characteristic even conditions innumerable historical works in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, which, especially in classical times, contain much valuable information, put together without being shaped into a real work of art; only rarely does the historian or philosopher reach a comprehensive view. The first attempt at a philosophy of history,

    Ibn Khaldūn

   <e type="italic">

   , in the 14th century, was rarely studied by his Arab compatriots.
  </p>
  <p>
   The accumulation of large amounts of material, which is carefully organized up to the present, seems typical of all branches of Islamic scholarship, from theology to natural sciences. There are many minute observations and descriptions but rarely a full view of the whole process. Later, especially in the Persian, Turkish, and Indo-Muslim areas, a tendency to overstress the decorative elements of prose is evident, and the contents even of official chronicles are hidden behind a network of rhymed prose, which is often difficult to disentangle.

   <assemblyref assemblyid="a21139"/>
   This tendency is illustrated in all branches of Islamic art: the lack of “architectural” formation. Instead, there is a kind of carpetlike pattern; the Arabic and Persian poem is, in general, judged not as a closed unity but rather according to the perfection of its individual verses. Its main object is not to convey a deep personal feeling but to perfect to the utmost the traditional rules and inherited metaphors, to which a new image may sometimes be added. Thus, the personality of the poet becomes visible only through the minimal changes of expression and rhythm and the application of certain preferred metaphors, just as the personality of the miniature painter can be detected by a careful observation of details, of his way of colouring a rock or deepening the shade of a turban. The same holds true for the arabesques, which were developed according to a strict ritual to a mathematical pattern and were refined until they reached a perfection of geometrically complicated figures, as in the dome of the Karatay Medrese in Konya (1251); it corresponds both to the most intricate lacelike
   <xref articleid="46362">
    Kūfic inscriptions
   </xref>
   around this dome and to the poetical style of
   <xref articleid="43269">
    Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī
   </xref>
   , who wrote in that very place and during those years. His immortal mystical poems comprise thousands of variations on the central theme of love. Although such a perfect congruency of poetry and fine arts is not frequently found, the precept about Persian art that “its wings are too heavy with beauty” can also be applied to Persian poetry. Thus, the tile work of a Persian mosque, which combines different levels of arabesque work with different styles of writing, is reminiscent of the way Persian poetry combines at least two levels of reality. And a perfect harmony is reached in some of the miniature manuscripts of Iran, Muslim India, or Ottoman Turkey, which, in their lucid colours and fine details of execution, recall both the perfection of the calligraphy that surrounds them on delicate paper and the subtlety of the stories or poems that they accompany or illustrate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those accustomed to the Western ideals of plasticity or form in the fine arts and literature or to the polyphonic interweaving of melodic lines in music have some difficulties in appreciating this art. The palaces seem to be without a fixed architectural plan; rooms and gardens are simply laid out according to daily needs. The historian offers an astounding amount of detailed reports and facts but with no unifying concept. The Muslim writer prefers this carpetlike form and adds colour to colour, motif to motif, so that the reader only understands the meaning and end of the whole web from a certain distance. Music, differentiated as it may be in the countries between Morocco and India, follows the same model: variations of highest subtlety on a comparatively simple given subject or theme.

   Drama and opera in the Western sense did not develop in the Islamic countries until the 19th century, and the art of the novel is also a comparatively recent development. There was no reason for drama: in the Muslim perception, God is the only actor who can do whatever he pleases, whose will is inscrutable. Humans are, at best, puppets on a string, behind whose movements those with insight detect the hand of the play master. Neither is the problem of personal guilt and absolution posed as it is in the West, nor is a
   <xref articleid="20799">
    catharsis
   </xref>
   , or purging of emotion, needed through drama. The atomist theory, widely accepted in Islam since the 10th century, leaves no room for a “dramatic” movement; it teaches that God creates everything anew in every moment, and what is called a “law of nature” is nothing but God’s custom, which he can interrupt whenever he pleases.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is true that certain other forms are found in the more folkloristic arts of Islam. Every region has produced poetry, in regional languages, that is livelier and more realistic than the classical court poetry, but poetry limited to one region tends to become restricted to certain fixed forms that can be easily imitated. Attempts at drama in Islam come from these more popular spheres in Iran (and, rarely, in Lebanon and Iraq), where the tragic events of the murder of
   <xref articleid="41622">
    Ḥusayn
   </xref>
   (680) at Karbala were dramatized in strange forms, using the vocabulary of traditional Persian poetry and theology. Thus, strangely hybrid forms emerge in the Islamic arts, highly interesting for the historian of religion and the student of literature but not typical of the classic Islamic ideals. Popular illustrations of tales and legends and those of some of the heroes of the
   <xref articleid="67367">
    Shiʿah
   </xref>
   are similarly interesting but atypical. In modern times, of course, there have been imitations of all forms of Western literary and visual arts: paintings in the
   <xref articleid="42220">
    Impressionist
   </xref>
   or
   <xref articleid="28108">
    Cubist
   </xref>
   style; the use of free verse instead of the stern classical forms; and novels, dramas, motion pictures, and music combining Western and Eastern modes. Belief in the Qurʾānic dictum “Whatever is on earth will perish save His face” discouraged artistic endeavour on a large scale, but the Prophetic tradition (
   <xref articleid="105855">
    Hadith
   </xref>
   ) “Verily God is beautiful and loves beauty” has inspired numberless artists and artisans, writers and poets, musicians, and mystics to develop their arts and crafts as a reflection of that divine beauty. A theory of
   <xref articleid="106009">
    aesthetics
   </xref>
   comprising the various artistic expressions of the Muslim peoples has yet to be written. Although there have been a number of studies in literary criticism, the formal indebtedness of some of the best modern poets and painters to the Islamic heritage has yet to be fully articulated.
  </p>

   It is notable that the arts of the Islamic peoples have had relatively little impact on other cultures, certainly far less than their artistic merit would appear to warrant. Europe has known art objects of Islamic origin since the early Middle Ages, when they were brought home by the Crusaders or manufactured by the Arabs in Sicily and Spain. Much admired and even imitated, they formed part of the material culture in those times, so much so that even the coronation robes of the German emperor were decorated with an Arabic inscription. At the same time, Islamic motives wandered into the
   <xref articleid="124798">
    belles lettres
   </xref>
   of Europe, and Islamic scientific books formed a basis for the development of Western science. Islamic culture as such, however, was rather an object of hatred than of admiration; a more objective appreciation of both the works of art and of literature did not start until the mid-17th century, when travelers told of the magnificent buildings in Iran and Mughal India and the first works from
   <xref articleid="59342">
    Persian literature
   </xref>
   were translated, influencing German classical literature. Indian miniatures inspired
   <xref articleid="109483">
    Rembrandt
   </xref>
   , just as European paintings were imitated by Islamic, especially
   <xref articleid="54157">
    Mughal
   </xref>
   , artists. Persian carpets were among the most-coveted gifts for princes and princesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   A bias against the cultures of the East persisted, however, until after the 18th-century
   <xref articleid="32680">
    Age of Enlightenment
   </xref>
   . The indefatigable work of the British scholars at Fort William at Calcutta (now
   <xref articleid="106113">
    Kolkata
   </xref>
   ) brought new literary treasures to Europe, where they were studied carefully by specialists in the emerging field of Islamic studies. Poets such as Goethe in Germany in the early 19th century paved the way for a deeper understanding of Islamic poetry. Islamic literatures, however, continue to be known to the larger Western public almost exclusively by

   . Even experts who were aware of the immense wealth of the literatures in the different Islamic languages (such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu) until the 20th century rarely appreciated the literatures from an aesthetic viewpoint; rather, they used them as a source for lexicography and for philological and historical research. The situation in Islamic fine arts and architecture was similar. Although the beauty of the
   <xref articleid="5709">
    Alhambra
   </xref>
   , for example, had already inspired European scholars and artists in the early 19th century, a thorough study of Islamic art as an independent field began only in the 20th century. Interest in the music of Islamic peoples, the arabesque-like uniformity of which seems strange to Western ideals of harmony, was also slow to develop.

    It would be almost impossible to make an exhaustive survey of Islamic literatures. There are so many works, of which hundreds of thousands are available only in manuscript, that even a very large team of scholars could scarcely master a single branch of the subject. Islamic literatures, moreover, exist over a vast geographical and linguistic area, for they were produced wherever the Muslims went, pushing out from their heartland in Arabia through the countries of the Middle East as far as Spain, North Africa, and, eventually, West Africa. Iran (Persia) is a major centre of
    <xref articleid="105852">
     Islam
    </xref>
    , along with the neighbouring areas that came under Persian influence, including Turkey and the Turkic-speaking peoples of Central Asia. Many Indian vernaculars contain almost exclusively Islamic literary subjects. There is an Islamic content in the literature of Malaysia and in that of some East African languages, including
    <xref articleid="70570">
     Swahili
    </xref>
    . In many cases, however, the Islamic content proper is restricted to religious works—mystical treatises, books on Islamic law and its implementation, historical works praising the heroic deeds and miraculous adventures of earlier Muslim rulers and saints, or devotional works in honour of the Prophet
    <xref articleid="105853">
     Muhammad
    </xref>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The vast majority of Arabic writings are scholarly; the same, indeed, is true of the other languages under discussion. There are superb historically important translations made by medieval scholars from Greek into Arabic; historical works, both general and particular; a range of religiously inspired works; books on grammar and on stylistics, on ethics and on philosophy. All have helped to shape the spirit of Islamic literature in general, and it is often difficult to draw a line between such works of “scholarship” and works of “literature” in the narrower sense of that term. Even a strictly theological commentary can bring about a deeper understanding of some problem of
    <xref articleid="106009">
     aesthetics
    </xref>
    . A work of history composed in florid and “artistic” language would certainly be regarded by its author as a work of art as well as of scholarship, whereas the grammarian would be equally sure that his keen insights into the structure of Arabic grammar were of the utmost importance in preserving that literary beauty in which Arabs and non-Arabs alike took pride.

    In this treatment of Islamic literatures, however, the definition of “literature” is restricted to

      <xref articleid="8157">
       Arabic language
      </xref>
      were to remain largely unquestioned after the spread of Islam. The Arabic poetry of pre-Islamic Arabia was regarded for centuries afterward as the standard model for all Islamic poetic achievement, and it directly influenced literary forms in many non-Arab literatures. The
      <xref articleid="105854">
       Qurʾān
      </xref>
      , Islam’s sacred scripture, was accepted by pious Muslims as God’s uncreated word and was considered to be the highest manifestation of literary beauty. A whole literature defended its inimitability (
      <e type="italic">
       iʿjāz
      </e>
      ) and unsurpassable beauty. Because it was God’s own word, the Qurʾān could not legitimately be translated into any other language; the study of at least some Arabic was therefore required of every Muslim. Arabic script was used by all those peoples who followed Islam, however much their own languages might differ in structure from Arabic. The Qurʾān became the textbook of the Muslims’ entire philosophy of life; theology, lexicography, geography, historiography, and mysticism all grew out of a deep study of its form and content; and in even the most secular works there can be found allusions to the holy book. Its imagery not unexpectedly permeates all Islamic poetry and prose.
     </p>
     <p>
      Between the coming of Islam in the 7th century and the 11th, a great deal of poetry and prose in Arabic was produced. One branch of literature in Spain and North Africa matured in perfect harmony with the classical ideals of the Muslim East, although its masters, during the 11th and 12th centuries, invented a few strophic forms unknown to Classical Arabic poetry. In modern times North African Muslim literature—mainly from

Central Asians also possess a considerable literature of their own, consisting in large part of epics, folktales, and mystical “words of wisdom.” The rules of prosody that hold for Arabic and Persian languages have been deliberately imposed on the Turkic languages on several occasions, notably by

     Islamic literatures and the West
    </title>
    <p>
     Small fragments of Arabic literature have long been known in the West. There were cultural interrelations between Muslim Spain (which, like the Indus Valley, became part of the Muslim empire after 711) and its Christian neighbours, and this meant that many philosophical and scientific works filtered through to western Europe. It is also likely that the poetry of Muslim Spain influenced the growth of certain forms of Spanish and French troubadour poetry and provided an element, however distorted, for medieval Western romances and heroic tales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Investigation of Eastern literatures by Western scholars did not begin until the 16th century in the Netherlands and England. First attempts toward an aesthetic understanding of Arabic and Persian poetry came even later: they were made by the British scholars of Fort William, Calcutta (now Kolkata), and by German pre-Romantics of the late 18th century. In the first half of the 19th century the publication of numerous translations of Eastern poetry, especially into German, began to interest some Europeans. The poetical translations from Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit made by the German poet

    External characteristics
   </title>
   <p>
    In order to understand and enjoy Eastern literature, one must study its external characteristics most carefully. The literatures of the Islamic peoples are “intellectual”; in neither poetry nor prose are there many examples of subjective lyricism as it is understood in the West. The principal genres, forms, and rules were inherited from pre-Islamic Arabic poetry but were substantially elaborated afterward, especially by the Persians.

   <h3 id="h61813">
    <title>
     Rhyme and metre
    </title>
    <p>
     Arabic poetry is built upon the principle of monorhyme, and the single rhyme, usually consisting in one letter, is employed throughout every poem, long or short. The structure of the Arabic language permits such monorhymes to be achieved with comparative ease. The Persians and their imitators often extended the rhyming part over two or more syllables (
     <e type="italic">
      radīf
     </e>
     ) or groups of words, which are repeated after the dominant rhyming consonant. The metres are quantitative, counting long and short syllables (
     <e type="italic">
      ʿarūḍ
     </e>
     ). Classical Arabic has 16 basic metres in five groupings; they can undergo certain variations, but the poet is not allowed to change the metre in the course of the poem. Syllable-counting metres, as well as strophic forms, are used in popular, or “low,” poetry; only in post-Classical Arabic were some strophic forms introduced into “high” poetry. Many modern Islamic poets, from Pakistan to Turkey and North Africa, have discarded the classical system of prosody altogether. In part they have substituted verse forms imitating Western models such as strophic poems with or without rhyme; since about 1950 free verse has almost become the rule, although a certain tendency toward rhyming or to the use of alliterative quasi-rhymes can be observed.

       qaṣīdah
      </e>
      (literally “purpose poem”), a genre whose form was invented by pre-Islamic Arabs, has from 20 to more than 100 verses and usually contains an account of the poet’s journey. In the classic pattern, the parts followed a fixed sequence, beginning with a love-poem prologue (
      <e type="italic">
       nasīb
      </e>
      ), followed by a description of the journey itself, and finally reaching its real goal by flattering the poet’s patron, sharply attacking some adversaries of his tribe, or else indulging in measureless self-praise. Everywhere in the Muslim world the
      <e type="italic">

      <e type="italic">
       qaṣīdah

      often was taken up by a description of nature or given over to some words of wisdom, or the poet took the opportunity to demonstrate his skill in handling extravagant language and to show off his learning. Such exhibitions were made all the more difficult because, though it varied according to the rank of the person to whom it was addressed, the vocabulary of each type of
      <e type="italic">

      <e type="italic">
       mas̄navī

      enabled the poet to develop the thread of a tale through thousands of verses. Yet even in such poetry only a restricted number of metres were employed, and no metre allowed more than 11 syllables in a hemistich. Metre and diction were prescribed in accordance with the topic; a didactic
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      (“12 months”) is a sort of lovers’ calendar in which the poet, assuming the role of a young woman of longing, expresses the lover’s feelings in accord with the seasons of the year. Apart from these, later writers tried to develop strophic forms. Sometimes
      <e type="italic">
       ghazal
      </e>
      s with the same metre were bound together as “stanzas” to form a longer unit through the use of a linking verse. When the linking verse was recurrent, the poem was called a
      <e type="italic">

     In all forms of poetry and in most types of prose, writers shared a common fund of imagery that was gradually refined and enlarged in the course of time. The main source of imagery was the
     <xref articleid="105854">
      Qurʾān
     </xref>
     , its figures and utterances often divested of their sacred significance. Thus, the beautiful Joseph (surah 12) is a fitting symbol for the handsome beloved; the nightingale may sing the psalms of
     <xref articleid="29469">
      David
     </xref>
     (surah 21:79 et al.); and the rose sits on
     <xref articleid="68613">
      Solomon
     </xref>
     ’s wind-borne throne (surah 21:81 et al.), and its opening petals can be compared to Joseph’s shirt rent by Potiphar’s wife (surah 12:25 ff.) and its scent to that of Joseph’s shirt, which cured blind Jacob (surah 12:94). The tulip reminds the poet of the burning bush before which Moses stood (surah 20:9 ff.), and the coy beloved refuses the lover’s demands by answering, like God to Moses, “Thou shalt not see me” (surah 7:143), but her (or his) kiss gives the dying lover new life, like the breath of Jesus (surah 3:49).

     Classical Persian poetry often mentions knights and kings from Iran’s history alongside those from Arabic heroic tales. The cup of wine offered by the “old man of the Magians” is comparable to the miraculous cup owned by the Iranian mythical king Jamshīd or to Alexander’s mirror, which showed the marvels of the world; the nightingale may sing “Zoroastrian tunes” when it contemplates the “fire temple of the rose.” Central scenes from the great Persian
     <e type="italic">
      mas̄navī
     </e>
     s contributed to the imagery of later writers in Persian-, Turkic-, and Urdu-speaking areas. Social and political conditions are reflected in a favourite literary equation between the “beautiful and cruel beloved” and “the Turk”: because in Iran and India the military caste was usually of Turkic origin, and because the Turk was always considered “white” and handsome, in literary imagery he stood as the “ruler of hearts.” Minute arabesque-like descriptions of nature, particularly of garden scenes, are frequent: the rose and the nightingale have almost become substitutes for mythological figures.
    </p>
    <p>
     The versatile writer was expected to introduce elegant allusions to Classical Arabic and Persian literature and to folklore and to know enough about astrology, alchemy, and medicine to use the relevant technical terms accurately. Images inspired by the pastimes of the grandees—chess, polo, hunting, and the like—were as necessary for a good poem as were those referring to music, painting, and calligraphy. Similarly, allusions in poetic imagery to the
     <xref articleid="8156">
      Arabic alphabet
     </xref>
     —often thought to be endowed with mystical significance or magical properties—were very common in all Islamic literatures.
    </p>
    <p>
     The poet had to follow strict rules laid down by the masters of rhetoric, rigidly observing the harmonious selection of similes thought proper to any one given sphere (four allusions to Qurʾānic figures, for example, or three garden images all given in a single verse). The poet was expected to invent new fantastic etiologies (
     <e type="italic">
      ḥosn-e taʿlīl
     </e>
     ): he had to describe natural phenomena in some elegant and surprising metaphor. Thus, “The narcissus has strewn silver in the way of the bride rose” means simply “The narcissus has withered”—for when the rose (dressed in red, like an Eastern bride) appears in late spring, it is time for the narcissus to shed its white petals, just as people would shed silver coins in the way of a bridal procession.

     Skills required of the writer
    </title>
    <p>
     The writer was also expected to use puns and to play with words of two or more meanings. He might write verses that could provide an intelligible meaning even when read backward. He had to be able to handle chronograms, codes based on the numerical values of a phrase or verse, which, when understood, gave the date of some relevant event. Later writers sometimes supplied the date of a book’s compilation by hiding a chronogram in its title. A favourite device in poetry was the question-and-answer form, employed in the whole poem or only in chosen sections.
    </p>
    <p>
     Writers were expected to demonstrate talent at both improvisation and elaboration on any theme if they wished to attract the interest of a generous patron. Poetry was judged according to the perfection of its individual verses. Only in rare cases was the poem appreciated as a whole: the lack of coherent argument, which often puzzles the Western reader in
     <e type="italic">
      ghazal
     </e>
     poetry, is in fact deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be idle to look for the sincere expression of personal emotion in Arabic, Turkish, or Persian poetry. The conventions are so rigid that the reader is allowed only a rare glimpse into the poet’s feelings. Indeed, such feelings were put through the sieve of intellect, and personal experiences were thereby transformed into arabesque-like work of artistry, if not art. In the hands of mediocre versifiers and prose writers, however, literature became mannered and completely artificial. The reader soon tires of the constantly recurring moon faces, hyacinth curls, ruby lips, and cypress statures (that is, tall and slender). Yet the great masters of poetry and rhetoric (who all have their favourite imagery, rhymes, and rhythmical patterns) will sometimes allow the patient reader a glimpse into their hearts by a slight rhythmical change or by a new way of expressing a conventional thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are, of course, quite crude generalizations. Folk poetry, for instance, has to be judged by different standards, though even here conventional forms and inherited imagery make it, on the whole, more standardized than might be wished. Only in the 20th century was a complete break with classical ideals made. Since then, sincerity instead of monotonous imitation, political and social commitment instead of empty panegyric, and realism instead of escapism have been the characteristic features of modern literatures of the Muslim countries.

    Historical developments: pre-Islamic literature
   </title>
   <p>
    The first known poetic compositions of the Arabs are of such perfect beauty and, at the same time, are so conventionalized that they raise the question as to how far back an actual poetic tradition does stretch. A great number of pre-Islamic poems, dating from the mid-6th century, were preserved by oral tradition. The seven most famous pieces are
    <xref articleid="54111">
     <e type="italic">

    </xref>
    (“The Suspended Ones,” known as
    <e type="italic">
     The Seven Odes
    </e>
    ), and these are discussed more fully below. The term
    <e type="italic">
     muʿallaqāt
    </e>
    is not fully understood; later legend asserts that the seven poems had been hung in the most important Arab religious sanctuary, the
    <xref articleid="44246">
     Kaʿbah
    </xref>
    in Mecca, because of their eloquence and beauty and had brought victory to their authors in the poetical contests traditionally held during the season of pilgrimage. Apart from these seven, quite a number of shorter poems were preserved by later scholars. An independent genre in pre-Islamic poetry was the elegy, often composed by a woman, usually a deceased hero’s sister. Some of these poems, especially those by the poet
    <xref articleid="45271">

    (died after 630) are notable for their compact expressiveness.

     The poet (called a

     </e>
     , a wizard endowed with magic powers) was thought to be inspired by a spirit (

      jinn
     </e>
     ,
     <e type="italic">
      shayṭān
     </e>
     ). The poet defended the honour of his tribe and perpetuated their deeds. Religious expression was rare in pre-Islamic poetry. In the main it reflects the sense of fatalism that was probably needed if the harsh circumstances of
     <xref articleid="14079">
      Bedouin
     </xref>
     life in the desert were to be endured.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most striking feature of pre-Islamic poetry is the uniformity and refinement of its language. Although the various tribes, constantly feuding with one another, all spoke their own dialects, they shared a common language for poetry whether they were Bedouins or inhabitants of the small capitals of
     <xref articleid="40551">
      al-Ḥīrah
     </xref>
     and
     <xref articleid="36664">
      Ghassān
     </xref>
     (where the influence of Aramaic culture was also in evidence).
    </p>
    <p>
     Arabic was even then a virile and expressive language, with dozens of synonyms for the horse, the camel, the lion, and so forth; and it possessed a rich stock of descriptive adjectives. Because of those features, it is difficult for foreigners and modern Arabs alike to appreciate fully the artistic qualities of early Arabic poetry. Imagery is precise, and descriptions of natural phenomena are detailed. The sense of universal applicability is lacking, however, and the comparatively simple literary techniques of
     <xref articleid="67844">
      simile
     </xref>
     and
     <xref articleid="52289">
      metaphor
     </xref>
     predominate. The imaginative power that was later to be the hallmark of Arabic poetry under Persian influence had not yet become evident.
    </p>
    <p>
     The strikingly rich vocabulary of Classical Arabic, as well as its sophisticated structure, is matched by highly elaborate metrical schemes, based on quantity. The rhythmical structures were analyzed by the grammarian Khalīl of Basra (died c. 791), who distinguished 16 metres. Each was capable of variation by shortening the foot or part of it, but the basic structure was rigidly preserved. One and the same rhyme letter had to be maintained throughout the poem. (The rules of rhyming are detailed and very complicated but were followed quite strictly from the 6th to the early 20th century.)
    </p>
    <p>
     As well as rules governing the outward form of poetry, a system of poetic imagery already existed by this early period. The sequence of a poem, moreover, followed a fixed pattern (such as that for the
     <e type="italic">
      qaṣīdah
     </e>
     ). Pre-Islamic poetry was not written down but recited, and sound and rhythm therefore played an important part in its formation, and the
     <e type="italic">
      rāwī
     </e>
     s (reciters) were equally vital to its preservation. A
     <e type="italic">
      rāwī
     </e>
     was associated with some famous bard and, having learned his master’s techniques, might afterward become a poet himself. This kind of apprenticeship to a master whose poetic style was thus continued became a common practice in the Muslim world (especially in Muslim India) right up to the 19th century.
    </p>
    <p>
     From pre-Islamic times the seven authors of
     <e type="italic">
      The Seven Odes
     </e>
     , already described, are usually singled out for special praise. Their poems and miscellaneous verses were collected during the 8th century and ever since have been the subject of numerous commentaries in the East. They have been studied in Europe since the early 19th century.

     , was foremost both in time and in poetic merit. He was a master of love poetry; his frank descriptions of dalliance with his mistresses are considered so seductive that (as orthodox Puritanism claims) the Prophet Muhammad called him “the leader of poets on the way to Hell.” His style is supple and picturesque. It grips the attention whether his poems sing of his love adventures or describe a seemingly endless rainy night. Of all Classical Arabic poets he is probably the one who appeals most to modern taste. At the other extreme stands
     <xref articleid="78481">
      Zuhayr
     </xref>
     , praising the chiefs of the rival tribes of ʿAbs and Dhubyān for ending a long feud. He is chiefly remembered for his serious
     <e type="italic">
      qaṣīdah
     </e>
     in which, old, wise, and experienced, he meditates upon the terrible escalation of war. Various aspects of Bedouin life, as well as the attitude of the Arabs to the rulers of the small kingdom of Al-Ḥīrah on the Euphrates River, are reflected in the poems of
     <xref articleid="54603">
      al-Nābighah al-Dhubyānī

     ,
     <xref articleid="7267">
      ʿAmr ibn Kulthūm
     </xref>
     , and Ṭarafah ibn al-ʿAbd. The boastful pride of the self-centred Arab warrior can be observed best in the poems of al-Ḥārith, who became proverbial for his arrogance. ʿAntarah ibn Shaddād, son of an Arab king and an enslaved Black woman, won such fame on the battlefield and for his poetry that he later became the hero of the

    </p>
    <p>
     Two other masters can stand beside these seven. Exciting for their savagery and beauty are some poems by Taʾabbaṭa Sharran and al-Shanfarā, both outlaw warriors. Their verses reveal the wildness of Bedouin life, with its ideals of bravery, revenge, and hospitality. Taʾabbaṭa Sharran is the author of a widely translated “Song of Revenge” (for his uncle), composed in a short, sharp metre. Shanfarā’s
     <e type="italic">
      lāmiyyah
     </e>
     (literally “poem rhyming in [the letter] l”) vividly, succinctly, and with a wealth of detail tells of the experiences to be had from life in the desert. This latter poem has sometimes been considered a forgery, created by a learned grammarian. The suggestion highlights the question, often posed, of how much pre-Islamic poetry is genuine and how much is the product of later scholars. Some modern critics—without proper justification—would dismiss the entire corpus as counterfeit.

     Prose
    </title>
    <p>
     While poetry forms the most important part of early Arabic literature and is an effective historical preservation of the Arab past glory, there is also a quantity of prose. Of special interest is the rhymed prose (
     <e type="italic">
      sajʿ
     </e>
     ) peculiar to soothsayers, which developed into an important form of ornate prose writing in every Islamic country. Tales about the adventures and battle days of the various tribes (
     <e type="italic">
      ayyām al-ʿArab
     </e>
     , or “The Days of the Arabs”) were told and handed down from generation to generation, usually interspersed with pieces of poetry. Proverbs and proverbial sayings were as common as in most cultures at a comparable level of development. The “literary” genre most typical of Bedouin life is the
     <e type="italic">
      musāmarah
     </e>
     , or “nighttime conversation,” in which the central subject is elaborated not by plot but by verbal associations that direct the listener’s mind from topic to topic. Thus, the language as language played a most important role. The
     <e type="italic">
      musāmarah
     </e>
     form inspired the later
     <e type="italic">

    </p>
    <p>
     It has been said—and this certainly holds true for the
     <e type="italic">
      musāmarah
     </e>
     —that Arabic literature demands attention from its listeners only in short bursts, for listeners are carried from verse to verse, from anecdote to anecdote, from pun to pun, along a theme whose broad outline is entirely familiar. Western scholars of the East have for this reason spoken of the “molecular,” or “atomic,” structure both of Classical Arabic literature and of traditional Islamic thought. An audience listening to one of the ancient bards—or to a modern poet or orator in the Muslim world—would be able to listen without tiring. The sheer emotive power of the Arabic language to enrapture and bewitch its listeners by sound alone should be kept in mind when any piece of Arabic literature is considered. Only a people endowed with peculiar sensibility to the word could properly appreciate the refinement of pre-Islamic poetry and be ready to accept the concept of divine revelation appearing through the word in the Qurʾān.

     It might be expected that a new and vigorous religion would stimulate a new religious literature to sing of its greatness and glory. This, however, was not the case. Maybe the once-boastful poets felt, at least for a while, that they were nothing but humble servants of God. At any rate, no major poet was inspired by the birth and astonishingly rapid expansion of Islam. Only much later did poets claim that their work was the “heritage of prophecy” or draw upon a tradition that calls the tongues of the poets “the keys of the treasures beneath the Divine Throne.” The old traditional literary models were still faithfully followed: a famous ode by Kaʿb, the son of
     <xref articleid="78481">
      Zuhayr

     , is different from pre-Islamic poetry only insofar as it ends in praise of the Prophet, imploring his forgiveness, instead of eulogizing some Bedouin leader. Muhammad’s rather mediocre eulogist,
     <xref articleid="39469">
      Ḥassān ibn Thābit
     </xref>
     (died c. 659), also slavishly repeated the traditional patterns (even including the praise of wine that had been such a common feature of pre-Islamic poetry at the court of
     <xref articleid="40551">

     Religious themes are to be found in the

     <xref articleid="74193">

     </xref>
     then gained the throne, and a new impetus in poetry soon became perceptible. The Umayyads were by no means a pious dynasty, much enjoying the pleasures of life in their residence in Damascus and in their luxurious castles in the Syrian desert. One of their last rulers, the profligate al-Walīd ibn Yazīd (died 744), has become famous not so much as a conqueror (although in 711 the Muslims reached the lower Indus basin, Transoxania, and Spain) but as a poet who excelled in frivolous love verses and poetry in praise of wine. He was fond of short, light metres to match his subjects and rejected the heavier metres preferred by
     <e type="italic">
      qaṣīdah
     </e>
     writers. His verses convey a sense of ease and gracious living. Al-Walīd was not, however, the first to attempt this kind of poetry: a remarkable poet from Mecca,
     <xref articleid="74190">
      ʿUmar ibn Abī Rabīʿah
     </xref>
     (died c. 712/719), had contributed in large measure to the separate development of the love poem (
     <e type="italic">
      <xref articleid="36671">

     <e type="italic">

     . Gentle and charming, written in attractive and lively rhythms, his poems sing of amorous adventures with the ladies who came to Mecca on pilgrimage. His lighthearted melodious poems still appeal to modern readers.
    </p>
    <p>
     In Medina, on the other hand, idealized love poetry was the vogue; its invention is attributed to Jamīl (died 701), of the tribe ʿUdhrah, “whose members die when they love.” The names of some of these “martyrs of love,” together with the names of their beloveds, were preserved and eventually became proverbial expressions of the tremendous force of true love. Such was Imruʾ al-Qays, who went mad because of his passion for Laylā and was afterward known as Majnūn (the “Demented One”). His story is cherished by later Persian, Turkish, and Urdu poets; as a symbol of complete surrender to the force of love, he is dear both to religious mystics and to secular poets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Notwithstanding such new developments, the traditional
     <e type="italic">

     form of poetry was by no means neglected during the Umayyad period. Moreover, as the satirists of Iraq rose to fame, the

     (died c. 728 or 730) excited and delighted tribesmen of the rival settlements of Basra and Kūfah (places that later also became rival centres of philological and theological schools). The work of these two poets has furnished critics and historians with rich material for a study of the political and social situation in the early 9th century. The wealth of al-Farazdaq’s vocabulary led one of the old Arabic critics to declare: “If Farazdaq’s poetry did not exist, one-third of the Arabic language would be lost.” Philologists, eager to preserve as much of the classical linguistic heritage as possible, have also paid a great deal of attention to the largely satirical poetry of al-Ḥuṭayʾah (died 674). The fact that Christians as well as Muslims were involved in composing Classical Arabic poetry is proved by the case of
     <xref articleid="5282">
      al-Akhṭal
     </xref>
     (died c. 710), whose work preserves the pre-Islamic tradition of al-Ḥīrah in authentic form. He is particularly noted for his wine songs. Christians and Jews had been included among the pre-Islamic poets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Prose literature was still restricted to religious writing. The traditions of the Prophet (Hadith) began to be compiled, and, after careful sifting, those regarded as trustworthy were preserved in six great collections during the late 9th century. Two of these—that of

     It was not until the Abbasids assumed power in 750, settling in Baghdad, that the golden age of Arabic literature began. The influx of foreign elements added new colour to cultural and literary life. Hellenistic thought and the influence of the ancient cultures of the Middle East, for example, contributed to the rapid intellectual growth of the Muslim community. Its members, seized with insatiable intellectual curiosity, began to adapt elements from all the earlier high cultures and to incorporate them into their own. They thus created the wonderful fabric of Islamic culture that was so much admired in the Middle Ages by western Europe. Indian and Iranian threads were also woven into this fabric, and a new sensitivity to beauty in the field of poetry and the fine arts was cultivated.

Their efforts helped to standardize “High Arabic,” giving it an unchangeable structure once and for all. By then the inhabitants of the growing towns in Iraq and Syria were beginning to express their love, hatred, religious fervour, and frivolity in a style more appealing to their fellow townsmen. Poets no longer belonged exclusively to what had been the Bedouin aristocracy. Artisans and freed slaves, of non-Arab origin, were included among their number. Bashshār ibn Burd (died c. 784), the son of an enslaved Persian, was the first representative of the new style. This ugly blind workman excelled as a seductive love poet and also as a biting satirist—“Nobody could be secure from the itch of his tongue,” it was later said—and he added a new degree of expressiveness to the old forms. The category of
     <e type="italic">

     (ascetic poems) was invented by the poet

      Abū al-ʿAtāhiyyah
     </xref>
     (died 825/826) from Basra, the centre of early ascetic movements. His pessimistic thoughts on the transitory nature of this world were uttered in an unpretentious kind of verse that rejected all current notions of style and technical finesse. He had turned to ascetic poetry after efforts at composing love songs.

     The same is said of

      Abū Nuwās

     (died c. 813/815), the most outstanding of the Abbasid poets. His witty and cynical verses are addressed mainly to handsome boys; best known are his scintillating drinking songs. His line “Accumulate as many sins as you can” seems to have been his motto, and, compared with some of his more lascivious lines, even the most daring passages of pre-Islamic poetry sound chaste. Abū Nuwās had such an incomparable command over the language, however, that he came to be regarded as one of the greatest Arabic poets of all time. Nevertheless, orthodox Muslims would quote of him and of his imitators the Prophet’s alleged saying that “poetry is what Satan has spit out,” since he not only described subjects prohibited by religious law but praised them with carefree lightheartedness.

      ) by Ibn al-Muʿtazz (died 908), caliph for one day, who laid down rules for the use of
      <xref articleid="52289">

      </xref>
      ,
      <xref articleid="67844">

      , and verbal
      <xref articleid="125522">
       puns
      </xref>
      . The ideal of these “modern” poets was the richest possible embellishment of verses by the use of tropes, brilliant figures of speech, and far-fetched poetic conceits. Many later handbooks of poetics discussed these rules in minute detail, and eventually the increasing use of rhetorical devices no longer produced art but artificiality. (Ibn al-Muʿtazz was himself a fine poet whose descriptions of courtly life and nature are lovely; he even tried to compose an epic poem, a genre otherwise unknown to the Arabs.) The “modern” poets, sensitive to colours, sounds, and shapes, were also fond of writing short poems on unlikely subjects: a well-bred hunting dog or an inkpot; delicious sweetmeats or jaundice; the ascetic who constantly weeps when he remembers his sins; the luxurious garden parties of the rich; an elegy for a cat; or a description of a green ewer. Their amusing approach, however, was sooner or later bound to lead to mannered compositions. The growing use of colour images may be credited to the increasing Persian influence on Abbasid poetry, for the Persian poets were, as has been often observed, on the whole more disposed to visual than to acoustic imagery.

      New attitudes toward love, too, were being gradually developed in poetry. Eventually, what was to become a classic theme, that of
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      (“ʿUdhrah love”)—the lover would rather die than achieve union with his beloved—was expounded by the

      theologian Ibn Dāʾūd (died 910) in his poetic anthology

      </e>
      (
      <e type="italic">

      ). This theme was central to the
      <e type="italic">

      poetry of the following centuries. Although at first completely secular, it was later taken over as a major concept in mystical love poetry. (The first examples of this adoption, in Iraq and Egypt, took place in Ibn Dāʾūd’s lifetime.) The wish to die on the path that leads to the beloved became commonplace in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu poetry, and most romances in these languages end tragically. Ibn Dāʾūd’s influence also spread to the western Islamic world. A century after his death, the theologian
      <xref articleid="41918">

      The conflict between the traditional ideals of poetry and the “modern” school of the early Abbasid period also led to the growth of a literary criticism, the criteria of which were largely derived from the study of Greek philosophy.

      Traditional poetry, meanwhile, was not neglected, but its style was somewhat modified in accordance with the new ideas. Two famous anthologies of Bedouin poetry, both called

      writers but who surpasses them all in the extravagance of what has been called his “reckless audacity of imagination.” He combined some elements of Iraqi and Syrian stylistics with classical ingredients. His compositions—panegyrics of rulers and succinct verses (which are still quoted)—have never ceased to intoxicate the Arabs by their daring hyperbole, their marvelous sound effects, and their formal perfection. Western readers are unlikely to derive as much aesthetic pleasure from Mutanabbī’s poetry as do native speakers of Arabic. They will probably prefer the delicate verses about gardens and flowers by Mutanabbī’s colleague in Aleppo, al-Ṣanawbarī (died 945), a classic exponent of the descriptive style. This style in time reached Spain, where the superb garden and landscape poetry of Ibn Khafājah (died 1139) displayed an even higher degree of elegance and sensitivity than that of his Eastern predecessors.

      Before turning to the development of prose, it is necessary to mention a figure unique among those writing in Arabic. This was
      <xref articleid="49584">
       al-Maʿarrī
      </xref>
      (died 1057), a blind poet of Syria, the sincerity and humanity of whose verses continue to appeal greatly to young Arabs. But al-Maʿarrī’s vocabulary is so difficult, his verses, with their double rhymes, are so compressed in meaning, that even his contemporaries, flocking to his lectures, had to ask him to interpret their significance. His outlook is deeply pessimistic and skeptical. Although his poems display a mastery of the Arabic traditional stylistic devices, they run counter to the conventional ideals of Arab heroism by speaking of bitter disappointment and emphasizing asceticism, compassion, and the avoidance of procreation.

      Development of literary prose
     </title>
     <p>
      During the Abbasid period, literary prose also began to develop. Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ (died c. 756), of Persian origin, translated
      <xref articleid="79125">
       the fables of Bidpai
      </xref>
      into Arabic under the title
      <e type="italic">
       Kalīlah wa Dimnah
      </e>
      . These fables provided Islamic culture with a seemingly inexhaustible treasure of tales and parables, which are to be found in different guises throughout the whole of Muslim literature. He also introduced into Arabic the fictitious chronicles of the Persian
      <e type="italic">
       Khvatāy-nāmak
      </e>
      (“Book of Kings”). This was the source of a kind of pre-Islamic mythology that the literati preferred above the somewhat meagre historical accounts of the Arab pagan past otherwise available to them. These activities demanded a smooth prose style, and Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ has therefore rightly been regarded as the inaugurator of what is called “secretarial literature” (that produced by secretaries in the official chancelleries). He also translated writings on ethics and the conduct of government, which helped to determine the rules of etiquette (
      <e type="italic">
       adab
      </e>
      ). His works are the prototype of the “Mirror for Princes” literature, which flourished during the late Middle Ages both in Iran and in the West. In this literature a legendary Persian counselor, Bozorgmehr, was presented as a paragon of wise conduct. Later, stories were invented that combined Qurʾānic heroes with historical characters from the Iranian past.

      A growing interest in things outside the limits of Bedouin life was reflected in a quantity of didactic yet entertaining prose by such masters as the broad-minded and immensely learned
      <xref articleid="43249">
       al-Jāḥiẓ
      </xref>
      (died 869). In response to the wide-ranging curiosity of urban society, the list of his subjects includes treatises on theology, on misers, on donkeys, and on thieves. His masterpiece is
      <e type="italic">
       Kitāb al-ḥayawān
      </e>
      (“The Book of Animals”), which has little to do with zoology but is a mine of information about Arab proverbs, traditions, superstitions, and the like. Al-Jāḥiẓ’s style is vigorous, loquacious, and uninhibited. His work, however, is not well constructed, and it lacks the clear sobriety of the “secretarial style.” Yet the glimpses it affords into the life of various strata of society during the 9th century have rightly attracted the special interest of Western scholars. Less impressive, but almost as multifaceted, are the treatises of Ibn Abī al-Dunyā (died 894).

     <p>
      The concept of
      <e type="italic">
       adab
      </e>
      was soon enlarged to include not only educational prose dealing with etiquette for all classes of people but belles lettres in general. The classic example of Arabic style for prose writers in this field, accepted as such for almost a millennium, is the writing of the Persian
      <xref articleid="41927">
       Ibn Qutaybah
      </xref>
      (died 889). His
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      (“Book of Choice Narratives”), in 10 books, each dealing with a given subject, provided a model to which numberless essayists in the Muslim world conformed. In his book on poetry and poets, Ibn Qutaybah dared, for the first time, to doubt openly that pre-Islamic poetry was incomparable. The most vigorous prose style was achieved by Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (died 1023), who portrayed the weaknesses of the two leading viziers, both notorious for their literary ambitions, “…with such bitterness,” as Gibb remarks, “that the book was reputed to bring misfortune upon all who possessed a copy.” This work, like others by Tawḥīdī that have quite recently been discovered, reveals the author’s sagacity and striking eloquence. His correspondence on problems of philosophy with
      <xref articleid="41925">
       Ibn Miskawayh
      </xref>
      (died 1030), the author of a widely circulated book on ethics and of a general history, helps to complete the picture of this extraordinary writer.

      Sometime about 800 the Arabs had learned the art of
      <xref articleid="108527">

      </xref>
      from the Chinese. Thenceforth, cheap writing material was available, and literary output was prodigious. The
      <e type="italic">
       Fihrist
      </e>
      (“Index”), compiled by the bookseller Ibn al-Nadīm in 988, gave a full account of the Arabic literature extant in the 10th century. It covered all kinds of literature, from
      <xref articleid="59722">

      </xref>
      to
      <xref articleid="108512">

      , but most of these works unfortunately have been lost. In those years manuals of composition (
      <e type="italic">
       inshāʾ
      </e>
      ) were written elaborating the technique of secretarial correspondence, and they grew into an accepted genre in Arabic as well as in Persian and Turkish literature. The devices thought indispensable for elegance in modern poetry were applied to prose. The products were mannered, full of puns, verbal tricks, riddles, and the like. The new style, which was also to affect the historian’s art in later times, makes a good deal of this post-Classical Arabic prose look very different from the terse and direct expression characteristic of the early specimens. Rhymed prose, which at one time had been reserved for such religious occasions as the Friday sermons, was now regarded as an essential part of elegant style.

      s, which tell the adventures of Abū Zayd al-Sarūjī, with a wealth of language and learning, come closer to the Western concept of short story than anything else in Classical Arabic literature. They abound in verbal conceits, ambivalence, assonance, alliteration, palindromes; they change abruptly from earnest to jest, from the crude to the most sublime, as the mid-20th-century scholar G.E. von Grunebaum pointed out in his evaluation of this form, which he regarded as the most typical literary reflection of the Islamic spirit. The work of al-Ḥarīrī has certainly been widely admired in the East; it has been imitated in

      and has formed part of the syllabus in Muslim high schools of India. The pleasure to be derived from the brilliant artifice and ingenuity behind such compositions has led to their being imitated in other literary fields: quite often, in later Persian literature, one finds poems—sometimes whole books—composed of letters without diacritical marks (which distinguish otherwise similar-looking letters) or even made up entirely of unconnected letters. In India, even a commentary on the Qurʾān, in undotted letters, was written (by Fayzī; died 1595).

      (died 1240), was Spanish in origin and was educated in the Spanish tradition. His writings, in both poetry and prose, shaped large parts of Islamic thought during the following centuries. Much of the later literature of eastern Islam, particularly Persian and Indo-Persian mystical writings, indeed, can be understood only in the light of his teachings. Ibn al-ʿArabī’s lyrics are typical
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      s, sweet and flowing. From the late 9th century, Arabic-speaking mystics had been composing verses often meant to be sung in their meetings. At first a purely religious vocabulary was employed, but soon the expressions began to oscillate between worldly and heavenly love. The ambiguity thus achieved eventually became a characteristic feature of Persian and Turkish lyrics.

      Among the Arabs, religious poetry mainly followed the classical

More sophisticated but less well known is an ode on the Prophet by the Iraqi poet Ṣafī al-Dīn al-Ḥilli (died 1350), which contains 151 rhetorical figures. The “letters of spiritual guidance” developed by the mystics are worth mentioning as a literary genre. They have been popular everywhere; from the western Islamic world the letters of Ibn ʿAbbād (died 1390) of Ronda (in Spain) are outstanding examples of this category, being written clearly and lucidly.

      (“girdled”) poem, written in the classical short metres and arranged in four- to six-line stanzas, was elaborated, enriched by internal rhymes, and, embodying some popular expressions in the poem’s final section, soon achieved a standardized form. The theme is almost always love. Among the greatest lyric poets of Spain was Ibn Zaydūn of Córdoba (died 1071), who was of noble birth. After composing some charming love songs dedicated to the Umayyad princess Wallādah, he turned his hand to poetic epistles. He is the author of a beautiful

      Historiography: Ibn Khaldūn
     </title>

      Any survey of western Muslim literary achievements would be incomplete if it did not mention the most profound historiographer of the Islamic world, the Tunisian
      <xref articleid="41923">
       Ibn Khaldūn
      </xref>
      (died 1406). History has been called the characteristic science of the Muslims because of the Qurʾānic admonition to discover signs of the divine in the fate of past peoples. Islamic historiography has produced histories of the Muslim conquests, world histories, histories of dynasties, court annals, and biographical works classified by occupation—scholars, poets, and theologians. Yet, notwithstanding their learning, none of the earlier writers had attempted to produce a comprehensive view of history. Ibn Khaldūn, in the famous
      <e type="italic">
       Muqaddimah
      </e>
      (“Introduction”) to a projected general history,
      <e type="italic">
       Kitāb al-ʿibar,
      </e>
      sought to explain the basic factors in the historical development of the Islamic countries. His own experiences, gained on a variety of political missions in North Africa, proved useful in establishing general principles that he could apply to the manifestations of Islamic civilization. He created, in fact, the first “sociological” study of history, free from bias. Yet his book was little appreciated by his fellow historians, who still clung to the method of accumulating facts without shaping them properly into a well-structured whole. Ibn Khaldūn’s work eventually attracted the interest of Western scholars of Asia, historians, and sociologists alike, and some of his analyses are still held in great esteem.

The amusing semicolloquial style of the historian Ibn Iyās (died after 1521) is an interesting example of the turn toward more direct and less ornate use of Arabic. While Classical Arabic was still the ideal of the literate, it had become exclusively a “learned” language. Even some copyists who transcribed classical works showed a deplorable lack of grammatical knowledge. It is hardly surprising that poetry composed under such circumstances should be restricted to insipid versification and the repetition of well-worn clichés.

     <xref articleid="64342">

     (“The Book of Sendbād [Sindbad]”). Rūdakī’s poetry, modeled on the Arabic rules of prosody that without exception had been applied to Persian, already points ahead to many of the characteristic features of later Persian poetry. The imagery in particular is sophisticated, although when compared with the mannered writing of subsequent times his verse was considered sadly simple. From the 10th century onward Persian poems were written at almost every court in the Iranian areas, sometimes in dialectical variants (for example, in Ṭabarestāni dialect at the Zeyārid court). In many cases the poets were bilingual, excelling in both Arabic and Persian (a gift shared by many non-Arab writers up to the 19th century).

      Influence of Maḥmūd of Ghazna

      The first important centre of Persian literature existed at Ghazna (present-day Ghaznī, Afghanistan), at the court of

       Maḥmūd of Ghazna

Himself an orthodox warrior, Maḥmūd in later love poetry was transformed into a symbol of “a slave of his slave” because of his love for a Turkmen officer, Ayāz. Under the Ghaznavids, lyric and epic poetry both developed, as did the panegyric. Classical Iranian topics became the themes of poetry, resulting in such diverse works as the love story of Vāmeq and ʿAzrā (possibly of Greek origin) and the

      <xref articleid="34029">

      </xref>
      (died c. 1020). He compiled the inherited tales and legends about the Persian kings in one grand epic, the
      <e type="italic">
       Shāh-nāmeh
      </e>
      (“Book of Kings”), which contains between 35,000 and 60,000 verses in short rhyming couplets. It deals with the history of Iran from its beginnings—that is, from the “time” of the mythical kings—passing on to historical events, giving information about the acceptance of the
      <xref articleid="106002">

      <xref articleid="106078">
       Alexander

      ’s invasion, and, eventually, the conquest of the country by the Arabs. A large part of the work centres on tales of the hero Rostam. These stories are essentially part of a different culture, thus revealing something about the Indo-European sources of Iranian mythology. The struggle between Iran and Tūrān (the central Asian steppes from which new waves of nomadic conquerors distributed Iran’s urban culture) forms the central theme of the book, and the importance of the legitimate succession of kings, who are endowed with royal charisma, is reflected throughout the composition. The poem contains very few Arabic words and is often considered the masterpiece of Persian national literature, although it lacks proper historical perspective. Its episodes have been the inspiration of miniaturists since the 14th century. Numerous attempts have been made to emulate it in Iran, India, and Turkey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other epic poems, on a variety of subjects, were composed during the 11th century. The first example is Asadī’s (died c. 1072) didactic
      <e type="italic">
       Garshāsp-nāmeh

      (“The Quintuplet” or “The Five”) and, though the names of Vīs or Vāmeq continued for some time to serve as symbols of the longing lover, it was the poetical work of Neẓāmī that supplied subsequent writers with a rich store of images, similes, and stories to draw upon. The first work in his collection,
      <e type="italic">
       Makhzan ol-asrār
      </e>
      (“Treasury of Mysteries”), is didactic in intention. The subjects of the following three poems are traditional love stories. The first is the Arabic romance of Majnūn, who went mad with love for Laylā. Second is the Persian historical tale of Shīrīn, a Christian princess, loved by both the Sasanian ruler Khosrow II Parvīz and the stonecutter Farhād. The third story,
      <e type="italic">
       Haft peykar
      </e>
      (“Seven Beauties”), deals with the adventures of Bahrām Gūr, a Sasanian prince, and seven princesses, each connected with one day of the week, one particular star, one colour, one perfume, and so on. The last part of the
      <e type="italic">

      is
      <e type="italic">

      </xref>
      in Africa and Asia, as well as his discussions with the wise philosophers. It thus follows the traditions about Alexander and his tutor, Aristotle, emphasizing the importance of a counselor-philosopher in the service of a mighty emperor. Neẓāmī’s ability to present a picture of life through highly refined language and a wholly apt choice of images is quite extraordinary. Human feelings, as he describes them, are fully believable; and his characters are drawn with a keen insight into human nature. Not surprisingly, Neẓāmī’s work inspired countless poets’ imitations in different languages—including Turkish, Kurdish, and Urdu—while painters illustrated his stories for centuries afterward.

The imagery he uses, however, is entirely inherited; none of it is original. (One of the most noted, and notorious, writers of this genre was the female poet Mahsatī [first half of the 12th century], who frequently addressed members of different professions in rather frivolous lines.) The quatrain was also popular as a means of embodying pieces of mystical wisdom. One has to do away with the old theory that the first author of such mystical
      <e type="italic">

      was Abū Saʿīd ibn Abū al-Khayr (died 1049). A number of his contemporaries, however, including Bābā Ṭāher ʿOryān (died after 1055), used simpler forms of the quatrain, sometimes in order to express their mystical concepts.

      The mystical poem
     </title>
     <p>
      Whereas the mystical thought stemming from Iran had formerly been written in Arabic, writers from the 11th century onward turned to Persian. Along with works of pious edification and theoretical discussions, what was to be one of the most common types of Persian literature came into existence: the mystical poem. Khwajah ʿAbd Allāh al-Anṣārī of Herāt (died 1088), a prolific writer on religious topics in both Arabic and Persian, first popularized the literary “prayer,” or mystical contemplation, written in Persian in rhyming prose interspersed with verses.

       The Conference of the Birds

      ), modeled after some Arabic allegories. It is the story of 30 birds who, in search of their spiritual king, journey through seven valleys. The poem is full of tales, some of which have been translated even into the most remote Islamic languages. (The story of the pious Sheykh Ṣanʿān, who fell in love with a Christian maiden, is found, for example, in

It is regarded by most of the Persian-reading orders of Sufis as second in importance only to the Qurʾān. Its translation into many Islamic languages and the countless commentaries written on it up to the present day indicate its importance in the formation of Islamic poetry and religious thought. Jalāl al-Dīn, who hailed from

      <e type="italic">
       Mas̄navī
      </e>
      . Mystical love poetry had been written since the days of Sanāʾī, and theories of love had been explained in the most subtle prose and sensitive verses by the Sufis of the early 12th century. Yet Rūmī’s experience of mystical love for the wandering mystic, Shams al-Dīn of Tabrīz, was so ardent and enraptured him to such an extent that he identified himself completely with Shams, going so far as to use the beloved’s name as his own pen name. His dithyrambic lyrics, numbering more than 30,000 verses altogether, are not at all abstract or romantic. On the contrary, their vocabulary and imagery are taken directly from everyday life, so that they are vivid, fresh, and convincing. Often their rhythm invites the reader to partake in the mystical dance practiced by Rūmī’s followers, the Mawlawiyyah (the name is derived from the honorific “Mawlānā”—meaning “Our Lord”—often bestowed on Rūmī). His verses sometimes approach the form of popular folk poetry. Indeed, Rūmī is reputed to have written mostly under inspiration, and, despite his remarkable poetical technique, the sincerity of his love and longing is never overshadowed, nor is his personality veiled. In these respects he is unique in Persian literature.

Amīr Khosrow, son of a Turkish officer but whose mother was Indian, is often styled, because of the sweetness of his speech, “the parrot of India.” (In Persian, it should be noted, parrots are always “sugar-talking”; they are, moreover, connected with paradise and are thought of as wise birds—thus models of the sweet-voiced sage.) He wrote panegyrics of seven successive kings of Delhi and was also a pioneer of Indian Muslim music. Imitating Neẓāmī’s
      <e type="italic">

      s contain many of the elements that in the 16th and 17th centuries were to become characteristic of the “Indian” style. Khosrow’s poetry surprises the reader in its use of unexpected forms and unusual images, complicated constructions and verbal plays, all handled fluently and presented in technically perfect language. His books on the art of letter writing prove his mastery of high-flown Persian prose. Khosrow’s younger contemporary, Ḥasan of Delhi (died 1328), is less well known and had a more simple style. He nevertheless surpassed Khosrow in warmth and charm, qualities that earned him the title of “the Saʿdī of Hindustan.”

Yunus, in Anatolia, however, was the first known poet to have caught something of Rūmī’s fervour and translated it into a provincial setting, creating “a Turkish vernacular poetry that was to be the model for all subsequent literary productions of popular religion.” Sometimes he used the inherited Arabo-Persian prosody, but his best poems are those written in four-line verses using syllable-counting metres. Yunus drew heavily on the reservoir of imagery that had been collected by the great Persian writing mystics, notably Rūmī, but his classical technique did not hinder the expression of his own unself-conscious simplicity, which led him to introduce new images taken from everyday life in Anatolian villages. His

      Ḥāfeẓ lived in Shīrāz; his pen name—“Who Knows the Qurʾān by Heart”—indicates his wide religious education, but little is known about the details of his life. The same is true of many Persian lyrical poets, because their products rarely contain much trustworthy biographical material. Ḥāfeẓ’s comparatively small collection of work—his
      <e type="italic">
       Dīvān
      </e>
      contains about 400
      <e type="italic">
       ghazal
      </e>
      s—was soon acclaimed as the finest lyrical poetry ever written in Persian. The discussion of whether or not to interpret its wine and love songs on a mystical plane has continued for centuries. Yet this discussion seems sterile since Ḥāfeẓ, whose verbal images shine like jewels, is an outstanding exponent of the ambiguous and oscillating style that makes Persian poetry so attractive and so difficult to translate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The different levels of experience are all expressed through the same images and symbols: the beloved is always cruel, whether a chaste virgin (a rare case in Persian poetry!), a professional courtesan, a handsome young boy (in most cases), God (mysterious and unattainable), or even the remote despot, the wisdom of whose schemes must never be questioned by his subjects. Because mystical interpretation of the world order had become almost second nature to Persians during the 13th century, the human beloved could effortlessly be regarded as God’s manifestation; the rose became a symbol of highest divine beauty and glory; the nightingale represented the yearning and complaining soul; wine, cup, and cupbearer became the embodiment of enrapturing divine love. The poets’ multicoloured images were not merely decorative embroidery but were a structural part of their thought.
     </p>
     <p>
      One must not expect Ḥāfeẓ (or any other poet) to unveil his personal feelings in a lyrical poem of experience. But no other Persian poet has used such complex imagery on so many different levels with such harmonious and well-balanced lucidity as did Ḥāfeẓ. His true greatness lies in this rather than in the content of his poetry. It must be stressed again that, according to the traditional view, each verse of a
      <e type="italic">
       ghazal
      </e>
      should be unique, precious for its own sake, and that the apparent lack of logic behind the sequence of verses was considered a virtue rather than a defect. (It may help to think of the glass pieces in a kaleidoscope, which appear in different patterns from moment to moment yet themselves form no logical pattern.) To what extent an “inner rhythm” and a “contrapuntal harmony” can be detected in Ḥāfeẓ’s poetry is still a matter for discussion, but that he perfected the
      <e type="italic">
       ghazal
      </e>
      form is indisputable. Whether he is praised as a very human love poet, as an interpreter of esoteric lore, or as a political critic, his verses have a continuing appeal to all lovers of art and artistry.

The leading figure in this circle was ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Jāmī (died 1492), who is sometimes considered the last and most comprehensive of the “seven masters” in Persian literature, because he was a master of every literary genre and did not specialize in one form only, as Anvarī and Ḥāfeẓ, among others, had done. Jāmī wrote an excellent imitation of Neẓāmī’s
      <e type="italic">

      , enlarging it by the addition of two mystical

      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      (“The Seven Thrones,” or “The Constellation of the Great Bear”). His interest in Sufism—he was initiated into the Naqshbandiyyah order—is clear from his famous biographies of the Sufi saints (which were an elaboration of a similar work by the 11th-century ʿAbd Allāh al-Anṣārī). In imitation of
      <xref articleid="64691">
       Saʿdī
      </xref>
      , Jāmī also composed the
      <e type="italic">
       Bahārestān
      </e>
      (“Orchard of Spring”), written in prose interspersed with verses. He left no less than three large divans, which contain work of high quality and demonstrate his gift for inventing picturesque images. Although his work abounds in lavishly ornamented verses, his style on the whole lacks the perfect beauty of Ḥāfeẓ’s lyrics and is already tending toward the heavier, more opaque “Indian” style. Jāmī also wrote treatises about literary riddles and various kinds of intellectual games, of which Muslim society in the late 15th century was very fond and which remain a feature of erudite Persian and Turkish poetry. His influence on the work of later poets, especially in Ottoman Turkey, was powerful.

      An interesting aspect of the Timurid court in Herāt was the attention given to Chagatai Turkish, which was spoken in the eastern regions of Islam (

He composed most of his lyrics and epics in Chagatai, which previously had been used by some members of the Timurid family and their courtiers for poetry but which became, thanks to him, an established literary medium. Even the arts-loving ruler of Herāt, Ḥusayn Bayqara (died 1506), wrote poetry in Turkic, following in every respect conventional literary taste.

      Prose works: the “mirrors for princes”
     </title>
     <p>
      During the first five centuries of literature written in Modern Persian, a multitude of prose works were written. Among them the political instruction tradition known as “mirrors for princes” deserves special mention. This genre, introduced from Persian into Arabic as early as the 8th century, flourished once more in Iran during the late 11th century. One important example is the

      felt disposed to write a

      (“Counsel for Kings”), although the idealized relationship he makes between religious theory and practical statesmanship was not very realistic. A later mystic to compose a similar work was Sayyid ʿAlī Hamadhānī (died 1385), who had settled in Kashmir and initiated its Sufi poetry. Others, especially in India, exhorted rulers in their writings.

The “cyclic story” form (in which several unconnected tales are held together by some device such as a common framework or narrator), inherited from India, became as popular in Iran as it had been in the Arabic-speaking countries. The

       Jawāmīʿ al-ḥikayat
      </e>
      (“Collections of Stories”), a veritable storehouse of tales and anecdotes, by ʿOwfī (died c. 1230). Anecdotes were an important feature of the biographical literature that became popular in Iran and Muslim India. Biographies of the poets of a certain age or of a specified area were collected together. They provide the reader with few concrete facts about the subjects concerned, but they abound in anecdotes, sayings, and verses attributed to the subjects, thus preserving material that otherwise might have been lost. Many of these biographical manuals, such as ʿOwfī’s
      <e type="italic">
       Lubāb al-albāb
      </e>
      (“Quintessence of the Hearts”) or Dowlatshāh’s
      <e type="italic">
       Tazkirat al-shuʿarāʾ
      </e>
      (“Biography of the Poets”), make agreeable reading. The authors concerned wished to demonstrate their own erudition and rhetorical technique as much as to immortalize their subjects; consequently, their books are important equally as stylistic documents and as historical sources. One of the most-remarkable works in this field is
      <e type="italic">
       Chahār maqāleh
      </e>
      (“Four Treatises”) by Neẓāmī-ye ʿArūẕī, a writer from eastern Iran. Written about 1156, this little book is an excellent introduction to the ideals of Persian literature and its writers, discussing in detail what is required to make a perfect poet, giving a number of instances of the sort of poetic craftsmanship thought especially admirable, and allowing glimpses into the various arts in which the literary man was expected to excel.
     </p>
     <p>
      This tendency toward “anecdotal” writing, which is also manifest in the work of a number of Arab historians, can be observed in the cosmographic books and in some of the historical books produced in medieval Iran. The cosmography of Ḥamdollāh Mostowfī (died after 1340),
      <e type="italic">
       Nuzhat al-qulūb
      </e>
      (“Pleasure of the Hearts”), like many earlier works of this genre, underlined the mysterious aspects of the marvels of creation and was the most famous of several instructive collections of mixed folkloristic and scientific material. Early miniaturists, too, loved to illustrate the most unlikely tales and pieces of information given in such works. Historical writing proper had been begun by the Persians as early as the late 10th century, when Balʿamī made an abridged translation of the vast Arabic historical chronicle by al-Ṭabarī (died 923).
     </p>
     <p>
      The heyday of historiography in Iran, however, was the
      <xref articleid="42112">
       Il-Khanid
      </xref>
      period (mid-13th to mid-14th century). Iran was then ruled by the successors of Genghis (Chinggis) Khan, and scholars began to extend their interest back to the history of pre-Islamic Central Asia, whence the rulers had come.

Although the writing of history became a firmly established art in Iran and the adjacent Muslim countries, the facts were unfortunately all too often concealed in a bombastic style and a labyrinth of cumbersome long-winded sentences. A history written by Vaṣṣāf (died 1323) is the most notorious example of turgidity, but even his style was surpassed by some later writers. These stylistic tendencies deeply influenced Turkish prose writing: 17th-century Turkish historical works, such as those of Peçevi (died c. 1650) and Naima (died 1716), for this reason almost defy translation. Later Persian prose in India suffered from the same defects. This development in Persian and Turkish prose is also reflected in the handbooks on style and letter writing that were written during the 14th and 15th centuries and afterward. They urged the practice of all the artificial tricks of rhetoric by this time considered essential for an elegant piece of prose.

     Islamic literatures should not be thought to consist only of erudite and witty court poetry, of frivolous or melancholy love lyrics full of literary conceits, or of works deeply mystical in content. Such works are counterbalanced by a great quantity of popular literature, of which the most famous expression is

     ). The tales collected under this title come from different cultural areas; their nucleus is of Indian origin, first translated into Persian as
     <e type="italic">
      Hazār afsānak
     </e>
     (“Thousand Tales”) and then into Arabic. These fanciful fairy tales were later expanded with stories and anecdotes from Baghdad. Subsequently some tales—mainly from the lower strata of society—about rogues, tricksters, and vagabonds were added in Egypt. Independent series of stories, such as that of
     <xref articleid="67902">
      Sindbad the Sailor
     </xref>
     , were also included. The entire collection is very important as a reflection of several aspects of Middle Eastern folklore and allows, now and then, glimpses into the court life of the various dynasties. Since its first translation into French (1704) and for the better part of three centuries, it fed a romantic notion in the West regarding the Middle East.

     (“Days of the Arabs”), which were stories of their tribal wars, and had dwelt upon tales of the heroic deeds of certain of their brave warriors, such as ʿAntarah. Modern research, however, suggests that his story in its present setting belongs to the period of the Crusades. The Egyptian queen Shajar al-Durr (died 1250) and the first brave Mamluk ruler,

     <xref articleid="34029">

     . Accounts of the glorious adventures of heroes from early Islamic times were afterward retold throughout Iran, India, and Turkey. Thus, the

      Dāstān-e Amīr Ḥamzeh
     </e>
     , a story of Muhammad’s uncle Ḥamzah ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, was slowly enlarged by the addition of more and more fantastic details. This form of
     <e type="italic">
      dāstān
     </e>
     , as such literature is called, to some extent influenced the first attempts at novel writing in Muslim India during the 19th century. The epics of Köroğlu are common to both Iranian and Turkish tradition. He was a noble warrior-robber who became one of the central figures in folk literature from Central Asia to Anatolia.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some popular epics were composed in the late Middle Ages and were based on local traditions. One such epic had as its basis the Turco-Iranian legend of an 8th-century hero,
     <xref articleid="3428">
      Abū Muslim
     </xref>
     , another the Turkish tales of the knight Dānishmend. Other epics, such as the traditional Turkish tale of Dede Korkut, were preserved by storytellers who improvised certain parts of their tales (which were written down only afterward). Also, the role of the Sufi orders and of the artisans’ lodges in preserving and transmitting such semihistorical popular epics seems to have been considerable. Apart from heroic figures, the Muslim peoples further share a comic character—basically a type of low-class theologian, called Nasreddin Hoca in Turkish, Juḥā in Arabic, and Mushfiqī in Tajik. Anecdotes about this character, which embody the mixture of silliness and shrewdness displayed by this “type,” have amused generations of Muslims.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shortly after the introduction of the printing press, Turkey and Iran began to produce cheap books, sometimes illustrated, containing popular romantic love stories. Large numbers of fairy tales were published in these cheap editions, and still other fairy tales were collected by European and Muslim folklorists.

    <p>
     A truly popular poetry is everywhere to be found: lullabies sung by mothers around the world have obvious similarities; workers sing little rhythmical poems to accompany their work; and nomads remember the adventures of their ancestors in their ballads. Such popular poems often contain dialect forms, and the metres differ from the classical quantitative system. Some of these simple verses, such as a two-line
     <e type="italic">
      lanḍay
     </e>
     in
     <xref articleid="58635">
      Pashto
     </xref>
     , are among the most graceful products of Islamic poetry. Many folk songs—lullabies, wedding songs, and dirges—have a distinct mystical flavour and reflect the simple Muslim’s love for the Prophet and trust in God’s grace even under the most difficult circumstances. Irony and wit are features of the riddle poem, a favourite form among Muslims everywhere. Folk poets were also fond of humorous descriptions of imaginary disputes between two entities—they might compose dialogues between coffee and tobacco (Morocco), between a big and a small mosque (Yemen), between a cat and a dog, or between a boy and a girl. All the Iranian and Turkic languages, too, possess a rich heritage of popular poetry, which in many cases appeals more immediately to modern tastes than does the rather cerebral high literature of the urban and court cultures.

    <p>
     Bābur’s autobiography is a fascinating piece of Chagatai Turkish prose and at the same time one of the comparatively rare examples of Islamic autobiographical literature. The classic example in this genre, however, was a lively Arabic autobiography by Usāmah ibn Munqidh (died 1188), which sheds much light upon the life and cultural background of a Syrian knight during the
     <xref articleid="110241">
      Crusades
     </xref>
     . A number of mystics, too, had written their spiritual autobiographies in a variety of languages, with varying degrees of artistic success. Bābur’s book, however, gives a wonderful insight into the character of this intrepid conqueror. It reveals him as a master of concise matter-of-fact prose, as a keen observer of daily life, full of pragmatic common sense, and also as a good judge of poetry. Bābur even went so far as to write a treatise in Chagatai Turkish about versification. Many of his descendants, both male and female, inherited his literary taste and talent for poetry; among them are remarkably good poets in Persian, Chagatai Turkish, and Urdu, as well as accomplished authors of autobiographies (
     <xref articleid="43246">

     ) and letters (
     <xref articleid="11273">

     ). Among the nobility of India, the Chagatai Turkish language remained in use until the 19th century. Lovely Chagatai Turkish verses were written, for example, by Akbar’s general, ʿAbd al-Raḥīm Khān-e Khānān (died 1626), who was a great patron of fine arts and poetry.

     In the Arab world there was hardly a poet or original writer of note during the three centuries that followed the Ottoman conquest, apart from some theologians (ʿAbd al-Wahhāb al-Shaʿrānī, died 1565; ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Nābulusī, died 1731) and grammarians. Yet Arabic still remained the language of theology and scholarship throughout the Muslim world; both Turkey and India could boast a large number of scholars who excelled in the sacred language. In Ottoman Turkey, Taşköprüzade (died 1560) compiled a historical survey of outstanding Turkish intellectuals in Arabic. Although a fine example of Islamic learning, in usefulness it does not compare to the bibliographic work in Arabic by Hacı Halifa (Kâtip Çelebi; died 1658), which is a valuable source for modern knowledge of literary history.

      Nevertheless, the main contribution of Muslim India to high literature was made in the Persian tongue. Persian had been the official language of the country for many centuries. The numerous annals and chronicles that were compiled during the 14th and 15th centuries, as well as the court poetry, had been composed exclusively in this language even by Hindus. During the

At this time what is known as the “Indian” style of Persian emerged. The translations from Sanskrit enriched the Persian vocabulary, and new stories of Indian origin added to the reservoir of classical imagery. The poets, bound to the inherited genres of

      (“ground”), in emulation of a classical model, and then to enrich it with newly invented tropes. The long-held ideal of “harmonious selection of images” was not always met. Difficult, even awkward grammatical constructions and inverted metaphors can be found. At times, pseudo-philosophical utterances in the second hemistich of a verse contrast strangely with semicolloquial expressions elsewhere. Objects recently introduced to India, such as the eyeglass or hourglass, were eagerly adopted as images by the poets, who wanted newfangled conceits to bolster their tortuous inventiveness. Notwithstanding the colourful descriptive poems written in praise of such subjects as Mughal palaces, marvelously illuminated manuscripts, rare elephants, or court scenes, the general mood of lyric poetry became more gloomy. The transitory nature of the world, also a central theme in classical Persian poetry, was stressed and depicted in bizarre images: “burnt nest,” “breakdown,” “yawning” (indicating insatiable thirst); these were some of the new “stylish” words.

      Yet some truly great poets are to be found even in this period. ʿUrfī, who left Shīrāz for India and died in his mid-30s in Lahore (1592), is without doubt one of the few genuine masters of Persian poetry, especially in his
      <e type="italic">
       qaṣīdah
      </e>
      s. His verses pile up linguistic difficulties, yet their dark, glowing quality cannot fail to touch the hearts and minds even of critical modern readers—more so than the elegant but rather cerebral verses of his colleague Fayzī (died 1595), one of Akbar’s favourites. Fayzī’s brother Abū al-Faḍl ʿAllāmī (died 1602), the author of an important, though biased, historical work, deeply influenced the emperor’s religious ideas. Among 17th-century Mughal court poets, the most outstanding is Abū Ṭālib Kalīm (died 1651), who came from Hamadan. Abounding in descriptive passages of great virtuosity, his poignant and often pessimistic verses have become proverbial, thanks to their compact diction and fluent style. Also of some importance is
      <xref articleid="64763">

      of Tabriz (died 1677), who spent only a few years in India before returning to Iran. Yet, of his immense poetical output (300,000 couplets), the great majority belongs to the stock-in-trade expression of the Persian-speaking world. Other poets described the lives and adventures of members of the royal families, usually in verbose
      <e type="italic">

      s (this kind of descriptive historical poetry was practiced throughout Muslim India and also in Ottoman Turkey). Outside the Mughal environment, the lyrics and

      The heir apparent of the Mughal Empire, Dārā Shikōh (executed 1659), also followed Akbar’s path. His inclination to mysticism is reflected in both his prose and poetry. The Persian translation of the
      <e type="italic">

      s, which he sponsored (and in part wrote himself), enriched Persian religious prose and made a deep impression on European idealistic philosophy in the 19th century.

      (died 1707), the heyday of both poetry and historical writing in Muslim India was over. Once more, orthodox religious literature gained preeminence, while poets tried to escape into a fantasy world of dreams. The style of the two leading poets of this age, Nāṣir ʿAlī Sirhindī (died 1697) and Mīrzā Bēdil (died 1721), is convoluted and obscure, prompting the Persian poet Ḥazīn (died 1766), who went to India in the early 18th century, to write ironic comments about its incomprehensibility. Bēdil, however, was a very interesting writer. His lyric poetry is difficult but often rewarding, while his many philosophical
      <e type="italic">

      <e type="italic">
       Chahār ʿunṣur

      (“Four Elements”) and contains some biographical details. His prose is nearly as difficult as his poetry, and, consequently, his works rarely have been read outside of India. His poetry, however, has had a great influence in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Many Persian-speaking people there consider him the forerunner of Tajik literature, because virtually everyone in Bukhara and Transoxania who tried to write poetry followed Bēdil’s example. His ideas, sometimes astoundingly modern and progressive, also impressed the 20th-century poet and philosopher

His skill in translating the sophisticated traditions of Persian literature into the not too highly developed idiom of the Pashtuns is astonishing. His lively lyric poems are his finest works, reflecting that passionate love of freedom for which he fought against the Mughals. The poems he wrote from prison in “hell-like hot India” are as dramatic as they are touching in their directness. Many members of his family took to poetry, and during the 18th century original works, both religious and secular, were composed in Pashto, and the classics of Persian literature were translated into that language.

In the religious field, the vigour and boldness expressed in the poems of Seyyid ʿImād al-Dīn Nesīmī (executed c. 1418) left their traces in the work of later poets, none of whom, however, reached his loftiness and grandeur of expression. The 14th- and 15th-century representatives of the classical style displayed great charm in their literary compositions, their verses simple and pleasing. Sultan Cem (Jem; died 1495), son of Mehmed the Conqueror, is an outstanding representative of their number. But soon the high-flown style of post-classical Persian was being imitated by Ottoman authors, rhetoric often being more important to them than poetical content. The work of

Fuzuli, moreover, like his fellow poets, would blend Arabic, Persian, and Azeri Turkish constructions and words to make up a multifaceted unit. The same difficulty is found in Turkish prose literature of the same period. It is a major task to unravel the long trailing sentences of a writer such as

      One branch of literature, however, was totally neglected by the sophisticated inhabitants of the Ottoman capital. Nobody thought much of the folk poets who wandered through the forgotten villages of Anatolia singing in simple syllable-counting verses of love, longing, and separation. The poems of the mid-17th-century figure Karacaoğlan, one of the few historically datable folk poets, give a vivid picture of village life, of the plight of girls and boys in remote Anatolian settlements. This kind of poetry was rediscovered only after the foundation of the

The introduction of Muslim intellectuals to Western literature and scholarship—the Egyptian al-Ṭahṭāwī (died 1873), for example, studied in France—ushered in a new literary era the chief characteristic of which was to be “more matter, less art.” The literatures from this time onward are far less “Islamic” than those of the previous 1,000 years, but new intellectual experiences also led to “the liberation of the whole creative impulse within the Islamic peoples” (James Kritzeck). The introduction of the

     Contact with the West also encouraged a tendency toward retrospection. Writers concentrated their attention on their own country and particular heritage, such as the “pharaonic myth” of Egypt, the Indo-European roots of Iran, and the Central Asian past of Turkey. In short, there was an emphasis on differentiation, inevitably leading to the rise of nationalism, instead of an emphasis on the unifying spirit and heritage of Islam.

      A considerable amount of Arabic literature was produced during the 20th century by numerous writers who settled in non-Islamic countries, especially in the United States and Brazil.

     The same changing attitude toward the function of literature and the same shift toward realism can be observed in Turkey. After 1839, Western ideas and forms were taken up by a group of modernists. Ziya Paşa (died 1880), the translator of

     (which became a popular textbook for 19th-century Muslim intellectuals), was among the first to write in a less traditional idiom and to complain in his poetry—just as Ḥālī was to do in India a few years later—about the pitiable conditions of Muslims under the victorious Christians. Ziya Paşa, together with

He, like his colleagues, had to endure political restrictions on writing, imposed as part of the harsh measures taken by Sultan

     against the least sign of liberal thought. Influenced by his work, later writers aimed to simplify literary language:

The stirrings of social criticism could be discerned after 1907. Mehmed Akif (died 1936), in his masterly narrative poems, gave a vivid critical picture of conditions in Turkey before World War I. His powerful and dramatic style, though still expressed in traditional metres, is a testimony to his deep concern for the people’s sorrows. It was he who composed the Turkish national anthem after

     Atatürk’s struggle for freedom also marks the real beginning of modern Turkish literature. The mainstream of novels, stories, and poems written during the 19th century had been replete with tears, world-weariness, and pessimism, but a postwar novel,

     <xref articleid="67007">

     </xref>
     (died 1920). The most-gifted interpreter and harshest critic of Turkey’s social structure was Sabahattin Ali, who was murdered during a flight to Bulgaria in 1948. His major theme was the tragedy of the lower classes, and his writing is characterized by the same merciless realism that was later to be a feature of stories by many left-wing writers throughout the Islamic world. The “great old man of Turkish prose,”
     <xref articleid="44699">
      Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu
     </xref>
     (died 1974), displayed profound psychological insight, whether ironically describing the lascivious life in a Bektashi (Muslim mystic order) centre or a stranger’s tragedy in an Anatolian village. Most of the Turkish novelists of the 1920s and ’30s concentrated on the problems of becoming a modern nation, and in particular they reinterpreted the role of women in a liberated society.
    </p>
    <p>
     Literary energies were set completely free when Atatürk introduced the Latin alphabet in 1928, hoping that his people would forget their Islamic past along with the Arabic letters. From this time onward, especially after the
     <xref articleid="73851">

     </xref>
     reform that was meant to rediscover the pre-Islamic roots of the Turkish language, Turkish literature followed the pattern of Western literature in all major respects, though with local overtones. Poets experimented with new forms and new topics. They discovered the significance of the Anatolian village, neglected—even forgotten—during the Ottoman period. Freeing themselves from the traditional rules of Persian poetry, they adopted simpler forms from Europe. In some cases the skillful blending of inherited Ottoman grace and borrowed French lyricism produced outstandingly beautiful poems, such as those of Ahmed Haşim (died 1933) and of Yahya Kemal Beyatlı (died 1958), in which the twilight world of old Istanbul is mirrored in soft evocative hues and melodious words. At the same time, the figure of
     <xref articleid="40428">

     (died 1963) looms large in Turkish poetry. Expressing his progressive social attitude in truly poetical form, he used free rhythmical patterns quite brilliantly to enrapture his readers. His style, as well as his powerful, unforgettable images, has deeply influenced not only Turkish verse but also progressive

     In Iran the situation resembled that in Turkey to a certain extent. While the last “classical” poet, Qāʾānī (died 1854), had been displaying the traditional glamorous artistry, his contemporary, the satirist Yaghmā (died 1859), had been using popular and comprehensible language to make coarse criticisms of contemporary society. As in the other Islamic countries, a move toward simplicity is discernible during the last decades of the 19th century. The members of the polytechnic college Dār ol-Fonūn (founded 1851), led by its erudite principal Reẕā Qolī Khān Hedāyat, helped to shape the “new” style by making translations from European languages. Nāṣer al-Dīn Shāh described his journeys to Europe in the late 1870s in a simple, unassuming style and in so doing set an example for future prose writers.

     At the turn of the century, literature became for many younger writers an instrument of modernization and of revolution in the largest sense of the word. No longer did they want to complain, in inherited fixed forms, of some boy whose face was like the moon. Instead, the feelings and situation of women were stated and interpreted. Their oppression, their problems, and their grievances are a major theme of literature in this transition period of the first decades of the 20th century. The “King of Poets,”

     One branch of modern Persian literature is closely connected with a group of Persian authors who lived in Berlin after World War I. There they established the Kaviani Press (named after a mythical blacksmith called Kaveh, who had saved the Iranian kingdom), and among the poems they printed were several by ʿĀref Qazvīnī (died 1934), one of the first truly modern writers. They also published the first short stories of

     (died 1951), whose stories—written entirely in a direct everyday language with a purity of expression that was an artistic achievement—have been translated into many languages. They reflect the sufferings of living individuals; instead of dealing in literary clichés, they describe the distress and anxiety of a hopeless youth. The influence of

     As in neighbouring countries, women played a considerable role in the development of modern Persian literature. The lyrics of Parvīn Eʿteṣāmī (died 1940) are regarded as near classics, despite a trace of sentimentality in their sympathetic treatment of the poor. Some Persian writers whose left-wing political ideas brought them into conflict with the government left for what is now Tajikistan. Of these, the gifted poet Abū al-Qāsim Lāhūtī (died 1957) is their most important representative.

     (died 1938), who chose Persian to convey his message not only to the peoples of Muslim India but also to Afghans and Persians.

    The modern period
   </title>
   <p>
    The modern period of Islamic literatures can be said to begin after World War II. The topics discussed before then still appeared, but outspoken social criticism became an even more important feature. Literature was no longer a leisurely pastime for members of the upper classes. Writers born in the villages and from non-privileged classes began to win literary fame through their firsthand knowledge of social problems. Many writers started their careers as journalists, developing a literary style that retained the immediacy of journalistic observation.

The novel gradually became more popular in the Arab world as the 20th century wore on. Mahfouz was probably the single most important figure in the genre’s widespread acceptance.

      The new attitudes that informed literature after World War II became even more conspicuous in poetry than in prose. Helped in part by French and English literary influences, Arabic poetry broke from classical tradition, a profound shift that also had its roots in efforts by nations across the Middle East to gain independence. The creation of the State of Israel also influenced the meaning and purpose of Arabic poetry.

      that many poets had adopted in the 1920s and ’30s. One of the first and most important attempts at creating a modern Arabic poetic diction was made in the late 1940s by the Iraqi poet and critic Nazik al-Malaika (died 2007), whose poems, in free but rhyming verse, gave substance to the shadow of her melancholia. Free rhythm and a colourful imagination distinguished the best poems of the younger Arabs: even when their poems did not succeed, their experimentation, their striving for sincerity, their burning quest for identity, their rebellion against social injustice, could be readily perceived. Indeed, one of the most noticeable aspects of contemporary Arabic poetry written during the second half of the 20th century was its political engagement, evident in the poems of Palestinian writers such as
      <xref articleid="403179">

      Almost the same situation developed in Iran. One notable poet was Forugh Farrokhzad, who wrote powerful and feminine poetry. Her free verses, interpreting the insecurities of the age, are full of longing; though often bitter, they are truly poetic. Poems by such critically minded writers as Seyāvūsh Kasrāʾī also borrow the classical heritage of poetic imagery, transforming it into expressions that win a response from modern readers. After 1979, many writers in the Islamic Republic of Iran felt the pinch of censorship, and much literary activity was curtailed.

     General considerations
    </title>
    <p>
     In the Arab-speaking world the problem of language loomed large into the 21st century. Classical high Arabic remained the common literary language of Morocco, Iraq, Tunisia, and Kuwait, although spoken Arabic in dialectal variations was beginning to be used—but tentatively—in higher literature. It was, and still is, more frequently employed in the popular spheres of theatre and cinema. But the local differences that exist in Arabic spoken from country to country have today become perceptible in literature; popular grammatical forms and syntactical constructions are occasionally used in modern poetry. A special problem arises in the North African countries, where French continues to be the chief literary language for most writers, especially in Morocco and Algeria. Yet there is no hard-and-fast rule: a leading member of Senegal’s literary community, Amadou Bamba M’backe, who founded the politically important group of the Murīdiyyah, wrote (quite apart from practical words of wisdom in his mother tongue) some 20,000 mystically tinged verses in Classical Arabic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throughout the Islamic world, radio, television, and other media have helped to disseminate literary works, prizes for literary achievements have stimulated interest in writing, and low-priced books have made the output of a growing number of writers available to the majority—the more so as literacy steadily increases among the population. But to what degree this means a continuation of the cultural role that Islamic literatures have played in the formation and education of society over the centuries is not yet clear. Literature was never restricted to a privileged high society; in the past even the illiterate villager and the “uneducated” womenfolk had a fund of poems, proverbs, songs, and quotations from classical sources that they knew by heart and to which they turned for both pleasure and spiritual strength.
    </p>
    <p>
     One final issue should be noted. The introduction in the second half of the 20th century of modern methods of criticism, of psychology and philosophy, kindled a new interest in significant figures of the Islamic past. Thus, to quote one instance, the figure of
     <xref articleid="38926">
      al-Ḥallāj
     </xref>
     (executed 922), who often served as a symbol figure of “the martyr of love” in both classical and folk poetry after the 11th century, was made the subject of a Turkish drama, a Persian passion play, and an Arabic tragedy, and he plays an important role in Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Indian Muslim lyrical poetry. He came to be interpreted as a symbol of suffering for one’s ideals, and he therefore was considered acceptable both to conservative Muslims and to progressive social critics.

     Early Islamic criticism
    </title>
    <p>
     The development of literature during the early Middle Ages soon produced among the Arabs much lively literary criticism. Even the choice of quotations made by the ancient grammarians from the classical stock of poetry implies a degree of critical (though subjective) activity. Attempts toward making a more objective study of poetic technique were first made in the late 9th century, when for the first time “beauties” and “faults” of verses were discussed and the ideals of the “new style” were defined by Ibn al-Muʿtazz in his
     <e type="italic">

     (

     (meaning) has been a matter of some controversy; many earlier critics stress the importance of outward form rather than of content. There was some question, too, as to whether the most “poetical” verse was that which was the most “untrue”—that is to say, hyperbolic—or that which was closer to the heart of things. The matter was debated along with the problem of inspiration and imagination and their function in poetry. The most thorough analysis of the art of poetry was made by the 11th-century philologist ʿAbd al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī, who gave equal weight to the idea and to the way it was expressed. An illuminating work about poetics was composed by the Tunisian critic al-Qarṭājannī (13th century), and this was carefully studied by the German scholar Wolfhart Heinrichs in
     <e type="italic">
      Arabische Dichtung und griechische Poetik

     (1969). This study analyzes al-Qarṭājannī’s theories in relation to
     <xref articleid="108312">

     ’s theories of poetics. (Heinrichs, who was at the time his study was published one of the few Islamic scholars specializing in the study of literary problems, showed that Classical Arabic criticism rarely interested itself in the poem as a whole but concentrated upon individual verses.) In later centuries, manuals of poetics and rhetoric written in every Islamic country reveal the prevailing interest in purely formal problems.

     A similar interest long dominated the work of Western scholars of the East. The first scholars who attempted to introduce Persian poetry to Western readers (such as

    </p>
    <p>
     Although a large amount of translation, mainly from Persian poetry, was produced in the 18th and 19th centuries, most of it suffered for lack of proper understanding: the translators took the poetical statements about wine and love or the outbursts against established religious forms at face value and failed to recognize them for the stereotyped forms and images they were. A deep study of the imagery of Persian, Turkish, and Arabic is essential for the proper understanding and enjoyment of their poetry and belles lettres. Austrian scholar Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall recognized this as early as 1818, though his own translations from the three great Islamic languages are nevertheless failures.

     In the 20th century the critical study of imagery in poetry produced in the Islamic world was taken up by Hellmut Ritter in his booklet
     <e type="italic">
      Über die Bildersprache Niẓāmīs
     </e>
     (1927; “On the Imagery of
     <xref articleid="55636">
      Neẓāmī
     </xref>
     ”), which gives a most sensitive philosophical interpretation of Neẓāmī’s metaphorical language and of the role of imagery in the structure of Neẓāmī’s thought. Ritter’s criticism is basic to the study of many other Persian poets. Slightly later the Polish scholar Tadeusz Kowalski tried to interpret the “molecular” structure of Arabic literature—the absence of large units of thought or architectural structure—typical of the greater part of Islamic literatures, which might be described as “carpetlike.” This “molecular” structure can be related to the atomist theories and occasionalist worldview embodied in Islamic theology, which, unlike Christianity, does not admit of secondary causes and requires only short spans of hope from the faithful. In a number of articles, and in many books, E.G. von Grunebaum pioneered this interpretation of literary structure during the 20th century. Other important critical works of the period include S.A. Bonebakker’s book on the rhetorical importance of
     <e type="italic">
      tawriyyah
     </e>
     (ambiguous wording), Manfred Ullmann’s excellent study of
     <e type="italic">

     </e>
     poetry and its place in Arabic literature, and C.H. de Fouchécour’s detailed analysis of the descriptions of nature in early Persian poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Among the Arabs themselves, modern literary criticism began during the early 1920s. Most famous was Taha Hussein’s attempt to prove the whole corpus of pre-Islamic poetry as counterfeit. All the Islamic countries, from Turkey to Pakistan and especially Iran, also sponsored reviews in which Western-trained scholars critically surveyed the literary achievements of the Islamic world.

   . A new art emerged, elaborated both from pre-Islamic Arabian music and from important contributions by Persians, Byzantines, Turks, Imazighen (Berbers), and Moors. In this development the Arabian element acted as a catalyst, and, within a century, the new art was firmly established from Central Asia to the Atlantic. Such a fusion of musical styles succeeded because there were strong affinities between Arabian music and the music of the nations occupied by the expanding Arabic peoples. Not all Arab-dominated areas adopted the new art; Indonesia and parts of Africa, for example, retained native musical styles. The folk music of the Berbers in North Africa, the Moors in Mauretania, and other ethnic groups (e.g., in Turkey) also remained alien to classical Islamic music. The farther one looks from the axis reaching from the Nile valley to Persia, the less one finds undiluted Islamic music.

    Nature and elements of Islamic music
   </title>
   <p>
    Islamic music is characterized by a highly subtle organization of melody and rhythm, in which the vocal component predominates over the instrumental. It is based on the skill of the individual artist, who is both composer and performer and who benefits from a relatively high degree of artistic freedom. The artist is permitted, and indeed encouraged, to improvise. He generally concentrates on the details forming a work, being less concerned with following a preconceived plan than with allowing the music’s structure to emerge empirically from its details. Melodies are organized in terms of
    <e type="italic">
     maqāmāt
    </e>
    (singular
    <e type="italic">
     maqām
    </e>
    ), or “modes,” characteristic melodic patterns with prescribed scales, preferential notes, typical melodic and rhythmic formulas, variety of intonations, and other conventional devices. The performer improvises within the framework of the
    <e type="italic">
     maqām
    </e>
    , which is also imbued with ethos (Arabic
    <e type="italic">
     taʾthīr
    </e>
    ), a specific emotional or philosophical meaning attached to a musical mode. Rhythms are organized into rhythmic modes, or
    <e type="italic">
     īqāʿāt
    </e>
    (singular
    <e type="italic">
     īqāʿ
    </e>
    ), cyclical patterns of strong and weak beats.
   </p>
   <p>
    Classical Islamic music is the aristocratic music of the court and the upper class, which underwent development and modification in the hands of gifted musicians throughout several centuries. Rhythmic and melodic modes grew in number and complexity, and new vocal and instrumental genres arose. In addition, a body of theoretical works grew up, influencing both Islamic and—in some cases—European music. Its later popularization did not alter its intimate and entertaining character.

     The relation of music to poetry and dance
    </title>
    <p>
     In pre-Islamic times music was closely connected with poetry and dance. Being essentially vocal, pre-Islamic music was an emotional extension of the solemn declamation of poems in Bedouin society. Later the art of vocal composition itself was largely based upon prosody: only by respecting the poetic metre in the music could the text, when sung, be clear in meaning and correct in pronunciation and grammatical inflection. In turn, prosody itself was used to explain the musical rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Words and rhetorical speech were the principal means through which the Bedouin expressed feelings. The
     <e type="italic">
      shāʿir
     </e>
     , or poet-musician, said to be possessed by supernatural powers, was feared and respected. His satirical song poems were a formidable arm against enemies, and his poems of praise enhanced the prestige of his tribe. Musician-poets, especially women, accompanied the warriors, inciting them by their songs, and those who fell in battle benefited from the elegies of the singer-poets. Musically, these elegies resembled the
     <e type="italic">
      ḥudāʾ
     </e>
     (“caravan song”), possibly used by camel drivers as a charm against the desert spirits, or
     <xref articleid="43660">
      jinn
     </xref>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Music and dance were closely associated from early times. Bedouin music had a pronounced collective character, with well-defined functions and usages, and dance occupied an important place in Bedouin life. Most common was a simple communal dance that emphasized common, or social, rather than individual movement. Places of entertainment in the towns and oases employed professional dancers, mainly women. Art dancing embellished events in the courts of the Sasanians, the pre-Islamic rulers of Persia. In the Islamic period, solo and ensemble forms of dance were an integral part of the intense musical activity in the palaces of the caliphs and in wealthy houses. Dance also was prominent in the
     <e type="italic">
      <xref articleid="30227">
       dhikr
      </xref>
     </e>
     ceremony of certain mystical fraternities; forms ranged from obsessional physical movements to refined styles similar to those of secular art dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the advent of Islam a deep change occurred in the social function of music. Emphasis was laid on music as entertainment and sensual pleasure rather than as a source of high spiritual emotion, a change mainly resulting from Persian influence. Knowledge of music was obligatory for the cultured person. Skilled professional musicians were highly paid and were admitted to the caliphs’ palaces as courtesans and trusted companions. The term
     <e type="italic">
      ṭarab
     </e>
     , which designates a whole scale of emotions, characterizes the musical conception of the time and even came to mean music itself.

     Music and religion
    </title>
    <p>
     Fashionable secular music—and its clear association with erotic dance and drinking—stimulated hostile reactions from religious authorities. As Muslim doctrine does not sanction permitting or prohibiting a given practice by personal decision, the antagonists relied on forced interpretations of a few unclear passages in the Qurʾān (the sacred scripture of Islam) or on the Hadīth (traditions of the Prophet, sayings and practices that had acquired force of law). Thus, both supporters and adversaries of music found arguments for their theses.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the controversy, four main groups emerged: (1) uncompromising purists opposed to any musical expression; (2) religious authorities admitting only the cantillation of the Qurʾān and the call to prayer, or
     <e type="italic">
      <xref articleid="3726">
       adhān
      </xref>
     </e>
     ; (3) scholars and musicians favouring music, believing there to be no musical difference between secular and religious music; and (4) important mystical fraternities, for whom music and dance were a means toward unity with God.
    </p>
    <p>
     Except in the Sufi brotherhoods, Muslim religious music is relatively curtailed because of the opposition of religious leaders. It falls into two categories: the call to prayer, or
     <e type="italic">
      adhān
     </e>
     (in some places,
     <e type="italic">

     ), by the
     <e type="italic">

     </e>
     , or
     <xref articleid="54144">
      muezzin
     </xref>
     , and the cantillation of the Qurʾān. Both developed from relatively solemn cantillation to a variety of forms, both simple and highly florid. The cantillation of the Qurʾān reflected the ancient Arabic practice of declamation of poetry, with careful regard to word accents and inflections and to the clarity of the text. Yet it was possibly also influenced by early secular art song. Opponents of music considered the cantillation of the Qurʾān to be technically distinct from singing, and it acquired a separate terminology. Synagogues and the Eastern Christian churches, unhampered by such opposition, developed extensive musical repertories based on melodic modes: the Eastern churches used the eight modes of

     Aesthetic traditions
    </title>
    <p>
     Even in its most complicated aspects, Islamic music is traditional and is transmitted orally. A rudimentary notational system did exist but it was used only for pedagogical purposes. A large body of medieval writing about music survives in which musical theory is related to various areas of intellectual activity, hence the extreme importance of understanding music as an element of the culture involved. The medieval writings fall mainly into two categories: (1) literary, encyclopaedic, and anecdotal sources, and (2) theoretical, speculative sources. The first group includes precious information on musical life, musicians, aesthetic controversies, education, and the theory of musical practice. The second deals with acoustics, intervals (distances between notes), musical genres, scales, measures of instruments, the theory of composition, rhythm, and the mathematical aspects of music. These documents show that, as in the modern era, medieval Islamic music was principally an individual, soloistic art. Small ensembles were actually groups of soloists with the principal member, usually the singer, predominating. Being an essentially vocal music, it displayed many singing and vocal techniques, such as special vocal colour, guttural nasality, vibrato, and other stylistic ornaments. Although the music was based upon strict rules, preexisting melodies, and stylistic requirements, the performer enjoyed great creative freedom. The artist was expected to bring his contribution to a given traditional piece through improvisation, original ornamentation, and his own approach to tempo, rhythmic pattern, and the distribution of the text over the melody. Thus the artist functioned as both performer and composer.
    </p>
    <h4 id="h13803">
     <title>
      Melodic organization
     </title>
     <p>
      Islamic music is monophonic; i.e., it consists of a single line of melody. In performance everything is related to the refinement of the melodic line and the complexity of rhythm. The notion of harmony is completely absent, although occasionally a simple combination of notes, octaves, fifths, and fourths, usually below the melody notes, may be used as an ornamentation. Among the elements contributing to the enrichment of the melody are microtonality (the use of intervals smaller than a Western half step or lying between a half step and a Western whole step) and the variety of intervals used. Thus, the three-quarter tone, introduced into Islamic music in the 9th or 10th century, exists alongside larger and smaller intervals. Musicians show a keen sensibility to nuances of pitch, often slightly varying even the perfect consonances, the fourth and fifth.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the fourth is the basic melodic frame, theorists organized the intervals and their nuances into genres, or small units, often tetrachords (units the highest and lowest notes of which are a fourth apart), combining genres into larger units, or systems. More than 130 systems resulted; on these are based the musical scales of the
      <e type="italic">
       maqāmāt
      </e>
      , or modes. The scale of a
      <e type="italic">
       maqām
      </e>
      can thus be broken down into small units that are of importance in the formation of melodies. A
      <e type="italic">
       maqām
      </e>
      is a complex musical entity given distinct musical character by its given scale, small units, range and compass, predominant notes, and preexisting typical melodic and rhythmic formulas. It serves the musician as rough material for his own composition. Each
      <e type="italic">
       maqām
      </e>
      has a proper name that may refer to a place (as Hejaz, Iraq), to a famous man, or to an object, feeling, quality, or special event. Emotional or philosophical meaning (ethos, or
      <e type="italic">
       taʾthīr
      </e>
      ) and cosmological background are attached to a
      <e type="italic">
       maqām
      </e>
      and also to the rhythmic modes. The Arabic term
      <e type="italic">
       maqām

      is the equivalent of

Each cycle consists of a fixed number of time units with a characteristic distribution of strong and weak beats and pauses. In performance some of the pauses may be filled in, but the underlying pattern must be maintained. Parallel to the growth of the number of melodic modes—from 12 in the 8th century to more than 100 in the 20th—is the increase in the number of rhythmic modes from 8 in the 9th century to more than 100 in the 20th.

      Musical forms
     </title>
     <p>
      The repertoire in common use comprises a wide variety of forms. One category includes unmeasured improvised pieces, such as the
      <e type="italic">
       layālī
      </e>
      , in which the singer puts forth the characteristics of the
      <e type="italic">
       maqām
      </e>
      , vocalizing long expressive syllables. An equivalent instrumental improvisation is called
      <e type="italic">
       taqsīm
      </e>
      , and this in some cases may be accompanied by a uniform pulsation, called
      <e type="italic">
       taqsīm ʿala al-wuḥdah
      </e>
      . The category of metrical songs embraces various poetic forms and metric structures, such as
      <e type="italic">
       qaṣīdah, dor
      </e>
      , and
      <e type="italic">
       muwashshaḥ
      </e>
      . Both categories, metrical and unmeasured, are almost always accompanied by either one or more instruments to enrich the performance. Important traditional forms combined both categories to create large compositions similar to a suite, using vocal and instrumental features. The whole was linked by the unity of the mode and a defined rhythmical development. Examples are the Andalusian
      <e type="italic">
       nūbah
      </e>
      , which survives in North Africa, the Persian

     The relation of Islamic music to music of other cultures

     The relation of Islamic music to the West reveals itself in both musical theory and practice. By the 9th century many Greek treatises had been translated into Arabic. Arabic culture preserved Greek musical writings, and most of those that reached the West did so in their Arabic versions. Arab theorists followed Greek models, often developing them further. The Muslim occupation of Spain and Portugal and the Crusades to the Middle East brought Europeans in contact with Arabic theoretical writings and the flourishing Islamic art music. Musical instruments such as the lute, the rebec (a small bowed instrument derived from the
     <e type="italic">
      rabāb
     </e>
     ), and the kettledrum (in the form of a pair of small kettledrums called nakers, from the Arabic
     <e type="italic">
      naqqārah
     </e>
     ) became firmly established in European music. Arabic writings were translated, among them the
     <e type="italic">
      De scientiis
     </e>
     , a work on the arts and sciences by the great 10th-century philosopher and musician
     <xref articleid="33714">
      al-Fārābī
     </xref>
     (Latinized as Alpharabius). Such translations give further indication of the influence exerted by Muslim writers. Arabian influence on European medieval music is difficult to prove. Borrowed elements were possibly completely transformed. The influence of Islamic music on European music is, at present, a subject of controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
     As early as 711, Arab conquerors reached India, and Mongol and Turkmen armies later invaded the Middle East, with resulting contact between Islamic and Far Eastern music. There are similarities between the modal systems of India (the ragas) and of the Middle East (the
     <e type="italic">
      maqām
     </e>
     system) and between some cosmological and ethical conceptions of music. The migration of musical instruments from the Islamic area to East Asia can also be traced. The Chinese oboe, the
     <e type="italic">

     </e>
     , apparently derived its name from its Middle Eastern counterpart, the
     <e type="italic">
      zornā
     </e>
     , or
     <e type="italic">
      sornā
     </e>
     . The Indian long-necked lute sitar, having a different number of strings from the Persian
     <e type="italic">
      setār
     </e>
     , received its name, and perhaps part of its form, from the
     <e type="italic">

     . The Chinese dulcimer,

     </e>
     (“foreign zither”), originated in the Middle Eastern
     <e type="italic">

     . On the other hand, the musical instruments appearing in the pre-Islamic Ṭāq-e Bostān reliefs in Persia show a mouth organ similar to the Chinese

    The history of Islamic music
   </title>
   <p>
    The earliest extant writings on Islamic music are from the end of the 9th century, more than 250 years after the advent of Islam. In the absence of historical documents, musicians, writers, and philosophers began to speculate on the origins of their music. They filled the gaps by legendary sources or vague traditions. Thus, Lamak is said to have made the first lute from the leg of his dead son, whose loss he lamented with it. His lamentation is considered to be the first song.

In the markets of the Arabs, particularly the fair at the western Arabian town of ʿUkāẓ, competitions of poetry and musical performances were held periodically, attracting the most distinguished poet-musicians. Their music, more sophisticated than that practiced in the nomadic encampments, was related to that of the

     was closely connected with that of Persia under the pre-Islamic Sasanian empire. The Sasanians esteemed both secular and religious music. In the belief of the Mazdak sect (a dualistic Persian religion related to
     <xref articleid="50539">
      Manichaeanism

     , a gnostic religion), music was considered as one of the four spiritual powers. In the king’s entourage musicians occupied high rank. Some became famous, such as Bārbad, to whom is attributed the invention of the complicated pre-Islamic system of modes. The compositions of Bārbad, who became a model of artistic achievement in Arabic literature, survived at least until the 10th century.

     The beginning of Islam and the first four caliphs
    </title>
    <p>
     Muhammad was said to have been hostile to music and musicians, yet there are indications that he tolerated functional music such as war songs, pilgrimage chants, and public or private festival songs. In addition, he himself instituted in 622 or 623 the
     <e type="italic">
      adhān
     </e>
     (“call to prayer”), chanted by the
     <e type="italic">

     (muezzin). For this task he chose the Abyssinian singer Bilāl, who became the patron of the
     <e type="italic">
      muʾadhdhin
     </e>
     and their guilds throughout the Islamic world. Within 12 years after Muhammad’s death, the armies of Islam took possession of Syria, Iraq, Persia, Armenia, Egypt, and Cyrenaica (in modern Libya). The contact with the refined cultures of the conquered and the appearance of a new class of warriors who benefited from the spoils of the conquered nations deeply affected Arabian society. In spite of the austere regime of the four
     <xref articleid="62732">
      orthodox caliphs
     </xref>
     (632–660), joy of life and eagerness for pleasure dominated the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Wealthy men competed with one another in hosting brilliant concerts, which were performed by enslaved musicians taken from the conquered populations. On occasions when enslaved musicians were liberated, they often became the pillars of musical life. In sophisticated literary and musical salons, contests revealed and rewarded the best talents. In this milieu the great Islamic musical tradition began to take shape, to be firmly established and codified in subsequent periods. A new generation of musicians was educated in the traditional manner and refined through constant hearing of the best music performed by the best masters. Through the contributions of the conquered “foreigners,” and through intense emulation of their music, new techniques, improved instruments, and elaborated musical forms developed. Persian lute tuning was adopted for the lute (
     <e type="italic">
      ʿūd
     </e>
     ), which became the classical instrument of the Arabs. Melodies and rhythms were regulated by a modal system that was later codified. Among the most famous female musicians was ʿAzza al-Maylāʾ, who excelled in
     <e type="italic">
      al-ghināʾ al-raqīq
     </e>
     , or “gentle song.” Her house was the most brilliant literary salon of Medina, and most of the famous musicians of the town came under her tutelage. Also famed were the female musician Jamīlah, around whom clustered musicians, poets, and dignitaries; the male musician Ṭuways, who imitated the melodies he heard from captive Persians; and Ṣāʾib Khāthir, a Persian merchant. Songs were generally accompanied by the lute (

     The Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties: classical Islamic music
    </title>
    <p>
     Under the Umayyad caliphate (661–750) the classical style of Islamic music developed further. The capital was moved to Damascus (in modern Syria) and the courts were thronged with male and female musicians, who formed a class apart. Many prominent musicians were Arab by birth or acculturation, but the non-Arab influences continued to play a predominant role in Islamic music. The first and the greatest musician of the Umayyad era was Ibn Misjaḥ, often honoured as the father of Islamic music. Born in Mecca of a Persian family, he was a musical theorist and a skilled singer and lute player. Ibn Misjaḥ traveled to Syria and Persia, learning the theory and practice of Byzantine and Persian music and incorporating much of his acquired knowledge into the Arabian art song. Although he adopted new elements such as foreign musical modes, he rejected other musical traits as unsuitable to Arabian music. Knowledge of his contributions is contained in the most important source of information about music and musical life in the first three centuries of Islam. This is the 10th-century
     <e type="italic">
      Kitāb al-Aghānī
     </e>
     , or “Book of Songs,” by Abū al-Faraj al-Iṣbahānī. In the 8th century Yūnus al-Kātib, author of the first Arabic book of musical theory, compiled the first collection of songs. Other notable musicians of the period were Ibn Muḥriz, of Persian ancestry; Ibn Surayj, also of Persian ancestry and noted for his elegies and improvisations (
     <e type="italic">
      murtajal
     </e>
     ); his pupil al-Gharīḍ, born of a Berber family; and Maʿbad, a Black student of Jamīlah. Like Ibn Surayj, Maʿbad cultivated a special personal style adopted by following generations of singers.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the end of the Umayyad period, the disparate elements of conqueror and conquered were fused into the style of classical Islamic music. With the establishment of the Abbasid caliphate in 750, Baghdad (in modern Iraq) became the leading musical centre. The Abbasid caliphate is the period of the golden age in Islamic music. Music, obligatory for every learned man, was dealt with in varied aspects—among them virtuosity, aesthetic theory, ethical and therapeutic goals, mystical experience, and mathematical speculation. The artist was required to possess technical proficiency, creative power, and almost encyclopaedic knowledge. Among the finest artists of the period were Ibrāhīm al-Mawṣilī and his son Isḥāq. Members of a noble Persian family, they were chief court musicians and close companions of the caliphs
     <xref articleid="39414">
      Hārūn al-Rashīd
     </xref>
     and
     <xref articleid="50418">
      al-Maʾmūn
     </xref>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Isḥāq, a singer, composer, and virtuoso lutenist, was the outstanding musician of his time. A man of wide culture, he is credited with authorship of nearly 40 works on music, which were subsequently lost. According to the “Book of Songs,” he is the originator of the earliest Islamic theory of melodic modes. Called
     <e type="italic">
      aṣbiʿ
     </e>
     (“fingers”), it structured the modes according to the frets of the lute and the fingers corresponding to them. Indications above each song in the “Book of Songs” show the mode, the type of third (major, minor, or neutral), and often the rhythmic mode. (The third is the interval encompassing three notes of the scale. It can vary considerably in exact size without losing its character. Western music uses the major and the minor third; much non-Western and folk music also uses a neutral third, between the major and minor in size.) The neutral third, introduced into Islamic music about this time, increased the number of melodic modes from eight to 12 by making more intervals available from which to build melodies. At this time the number of rhythmic modes varied from six to eight, their actual structure and content differing from author to author.
    </p>
    <p>
     Isḥāq and Ibrāhīm al-Mawṣilī actively participated in the contemporary controversy between modernism, a Persian romantic style tending toward exuberance of embellishments, and Arabian classicism, characterized by simplicity and artistic severity. The Mawṣilīs represented the older classical tradition; the proponents of modernism were Ibn Jāmiʿ and the celebrated singer Prince Ibrāhīm ibn al-Mahdī.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the second half of the 8th century, the extensive Islamic literature of music theory began to flourish. Greek treatises were translated into Arabic, and scholars, who were acquainted with the Greek writings, began to devote books or sections of books to the theory of music. In their works they expanded, changed, improved, or shed new light on Greek musical theory. The well-known philosopher al-Kindī, who was deeply immersed in Greek learning, wrote more than 13 musical treatises, including the earliest Arabic musical treatise that is known to have survived. He also dealt with the theory of ethos (
     <e type="italic">
      taʾthīr
     </e>
     ) and with cosmological aspects of music. Members of the Ikhwān al-Ṣafā, an important 10th-century brotherhood, dealt also with these two themes and advanced a theory of sound that went well beyond ancient Greek theories. Philosophers such as al-Fārābī, author of the monumental
     <e type="italic">
      Kitāb al-musīqī al-Kabīr
     </e>
     (“Grand Book on Music”), and Ibn Sīnā (known in Europe as Avicenna) dealt with such topics as the theory of sound, intervals, genres and systems, composition, rhythm, and instruments, as did others such as al-Sarakhsī, his contemporary Thābit ibn Qurrah, and Avicenna’s pupil Ibn Zaylā. The last important theorist to emerge during the Abbasid period was Ṣafī al-Dīn, who codified the elements of the modal practice as it was then known into a highly sophisticated system. His achievement became the chief model for subsequent generations. In the numerous treatises written between the 13th and 19th centuries, the system devised by Ṣafī al-Dīn was split into multiple local traditions.

The most imposing figure in this development is Ziryāb (flourished 9th century), a pupil of Isḥāq al-Mawṣilī, who, because of the jealousy of his teacher, emigrated from Baghdad to Spain. A virtuoso singer and the leading musician at the court of

     , Ziryāb introduced a fifth string to the lute, devised a number of new forms of composition, and developed a variety of new methods of teaching singing in his well-known school of music. Musical activity spread to large towns, and Sevilla (Seville) became a leading centre of musical-instrument manufacture.

    <p>
     New poetic forms were developed, such as the

     (“suite”), a form that included songs and instrumental music, free or metrical, that were linked together by melodic mode and rhythmic patterns. The 24 traditional

Persia enjoyed artistic independence for about 450 years, until 1918; but during this period a huge area, from the Balkans to Tunisia, was submitted to a strong Turkish influence, which itself was heavily influenced by Arab and Persian music.

     The modern period
    </title>
    <p>
     From the beginning of the 19th century, Islamic music was affected by the intensification of contacts and relationships with Western music. For the first time Islamic music existed in juxtaposition with Western music. For example, European composers and musicians were summoned to create military bands and conservatories in Turkey (1826) and in Persia (1856), and Giuseppe Verdi’s opera
     <e type="italic">
      Aida
     </e>
     inaugurated the opera house in Cairo in 1871. Expanding contact with Western music caused certain alterations in traditional musical styles. There was a widespread musical renaissance, with two main centres: the leading school in Egypt was open to modernism and Western influences, while in Syria and Iraq traditional music was supported. Music in Syria and Iraq, together with North African, Iranian, and Turkish music, remained restricted to its own periphery. The Egyptian school developed Middle Eastern music in what can be called the mainstream style; and this music was widely diffused through the media of radio, television, recordings, and the cinema. Mainstream music borrowed instruments such as the cello, saxophone, and accordion; melodies and rhythms from European serious and light music; the concept of large ensembles; and the use of electronic amplification. Emphasis shifted from the display of individual virtuosity and personal creativity to performance as an ensemble, and the use of short songs underscored the separation, rather than the traditional union, of composer and performer. Classical and local genres coexist, however, with the innovative mainstream style.

    <p>
     Persian art music continues to be organized into 12 traditional modes, or
     <e type="italic">
      dastgāh
     </e>
     , each of which contains a repertory of from 20 to 50 small pieces called
     <e type="italic">
      gūsheh
     </e>
     s (“corners”). In performance of instrumental and vocal music, the artist improvises on the chosen

     in a specific order.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vocal music still predominates even in countries such as Iran, in which instrumental music is cultivated independently. Thus, almost all of the Middle Eastern musicians who are well known are singers; those particularly influential in the modern renaissance, in chronological order, include ʿAbduh al-Ḥamūlī, Dāʾūd Ḥusnī, Sayyid Darwīsh, ʿAbd al-Wahhāb, Umm Kulthūm, Farīd al-Aṭrash, Fayrouz, Rashid al-Hundarashi, Ṣadīqah al-Mulāya, and Muḥammad al-Gubanshi.
    </p>
    <p>
     Modern Arab theorists also have produced valuable treatises. For example, the 19th-century theorists Michel Muchaqa of Damascus and Mohammed Chehab al-Dīn of Cairo introduced the theoretical division of the scale into 24 quarter tones. In 1932 the international Congress of Arabian Music was held in Cairo, providing a forum for current analysis of subjects such as musical scales, modes, rhythms, and musical forms.

   Dance and theatre
  </title>
  <p>
   The performing arts have received comparatively little attention in the otherwise rich literature of the Islamic peoples. This is most probably a result of the suspicions entertained by some orthodox Muslim scholars concerning the propriety of dance and theatre. Because this applies particularly in relation to the vexing theological question of human portrayal and its connection with idolatry, the performing arts have traditionally been regarded by the faithful with more than usual caution. Even as late as the 19th and early 20th centuries, most research on the subject, in what may loosely be called the Islamic world, was carried out by Western scholars, chiefly from European nations, and only in the 20th century did indigenous scholars start publishing significant research on the subject.

   There are no known references to dance or theatre in pre-Islamic Arabia, although nomad tribes were probably acquainted with dance. The Islamic peoples themselves seem to have developed this particular art form less than they did music or architecture, and, in addition to medieval Islam’s cool attitude toward dance and theatre as art forms, it must be added that most women, leading a life of seclusion, could hardly be expected to play an active part in them, except in private and exclusive gatherings. Nevertheless, there has been an active tradition of folk dance in most Islamic countries, in addition to dancing as an entertainment spectacle and, particularly in Persia, as an art form. A ritual dance was instituted in the Sufi mystical order of the
   <xref articleid="51529">
    Mawlawiyyah
   </xref>
   (Mevleviyah) in Turkey; performed by dervishes (members of the mystical order), it is considered to be a manifestation of mystical ecstasy rather than an entertainment or an expression of aesthetic urges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The theatre has not flourished as a major art under Islam, although as a form of popular entertainment, particularly in
   <xref articleid="52774">
    mime
   </xref>
   and shadow puppet shows, it has persisted vigorously. Nevertheless, the theatre with live actors received support from the Ottomans in Turkey, and a live popular drama was strong in Persia, where a passion play also took root. Otherwise, the theatrical record of Islam is meagre. Moreover, few neighbouring peoples had a well-developed theatre of their own. Hence, outside stimulus was lacking, and the Islamic disapproval of idolatry was so intense that when the shadow theatre evolved in the East, in the late Middle Ages, the
   <xref articleid="109462">
    puppets
   </xref>
   were regularly punched with holes to show that they were lifeless. Nonetheless, drama has had some ties with religion, as in Iran and other areas where the Shiʿi branch of Islam is concentrated and a passion play developed, rooted in traumatic memories of the bloody warfare of Islam’s early years. This was a local phenomenon, uninfluenced by Christian Europe, and, though stereotyped, it movingly reenacted Shiʿi martyrdom.
  </p>
  <p>
   A popular theatre, frequently including dance, evolved independently from about the 17th century in some Muslim countries. Western European and, later, U.S. influences were largely the main factors in the development of an artistic theatre in the 19th century and beyond. But conservative Muslims have consistently disapproved of theatre, and in Saudi Arabia, for example, no native theatrical establishment exists. In such an atmosphere, women’s roles were at first taken by men; later, Christian and Jewish women took the roles, and only in the 20th century did Muslim women begin to participate.

     Folk dancing existed among medieval Islamic peoples, but the sources that record dancing are mainly concerned with artistic dance, which was performed chiefly at the caliph’s palace by skilled women. The aristocracy was quick to imitate this patronage by providing similar performances, its members vying with one another on festive occasions. One of those dances, the

      Though now performed and fostered chiefly as an expression of national culture, folk dances were long regarded as pure entertainment and were either combined with theatrical shows or presented alone. Dance performances, accompanied by music, took place in a special hall or outdoors; many dancers, particularly the males, were also mimes. Sometimes the dance enacted a pantomime, as in Turkey, of physical love or of a stag hunt. Folk dance, except in Iran, has almost always been mimetic or narrative, a tradition still fostered by many tribes.

     <p>
      The Turks considered dancing a profession for the lowborn; as a result, most dancers were members of minority groups—mostly Greeks, Jews, and Armenians. This judgment has usually applied to the status of professional dancers and indeed to most professional entertainers at most periods and in most societies until modern times. In 19th-century Egypt both male and female dancers were regarded as public entertainers. Many of the women entertainers (
      <e type="italic">
       ghawāzī
      </e>
      ) belonged to a single tribe and were usually considered little better than prostitutes. The erotic element in dancing became focused in the belly dance, which has become the leading form of exhibition dance in modern Turkey and the Arab countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      The mimetic tradition of folk dance has blended well with comedy in countries of the Sunni persuasion and with the passion-play tragedy in Shiʿi countries. Yet in the late 20th century theatre was increasingly divorced from dance, most plays being consciously modeled on European patterns; only in the operetta does the old combination remain.

      Dance as an art form
     </title>
     <p>
      In pre-Islamic times in Iran, dance was both an art form and a popular entertainment. There are pictures of dancers in miniatures, on pottery, and on walls, friezes, and coins. Some of the ancient dances lived on partially in tribal dances, but again, under Islam’s restrictions on women, the art became a male monopoly. Women were permitted to dance in private, however, as in the harem. Iran is perhaps the only Muslim country with a tradition of dance regarded as an art form. When revived after World War II, folk dancing was encouraged and adapted for the foundation of a national ballet. Muslim orthodoxy’s very uncertainty over the exact status of the artistic dance ensured that it was always considered as an adjunct to music. Accordingly, although there are many detailed treatises on Islamic music, none is available on dance.

      There is one outstanding example of pure dance: that of the whirling dervishes, an art that has been practiced since the 13th century. The procedure is part of a Muslim ceremony called the

      </e>
      , the purpose of which is to glorify God and seek spiritual perfection. Not all dervish orders dance; some simply stand on one foot and move the other foot to music. Those who dance, or, rather, whirl, are the Mawlawī dervishes, an order that was founded by the Persian poet and mystic

They throw back their heads and raise the palms of their hands, a symbol of giving and taking. The rhythm accelerates, and they whirl faster and faster. In this way they enter a trance in an attempt to lose their personal identities and to attain union with the Almighty. Later they may sit, pray, and begin all over again. The

     In lands where the Sunni sect was strong, mime shows were frequent and popular attractions during the later Middle Ages. The Ottoman sultans were accompanied on military campaigns by their own troupe of actors; and, as the Ottoman Empire grew larger and richer, the court became ever more partial to entertainment, whether at the accession of a sultan, a royal wedding, a circumcision, an official visit, or a victory. On such occasions, dances and theatrical performances played their part along with parades, fireworks, music, mock fights, and circus performances in one huge, sumptuous pageant. This lavishing of entertainment reached a height of splendour that the admiring Ottoman aristocracy strove to imitate throughout the empire. In Arabia and North Africa, popular shows on a lesser scale were performed in the open air. Another aspect of the Islamic theatre was represented in the shadow plays, which were given chiefly to pass the time during the month of fasting, Ramadan (the sacred ninth month of the Muslim year).

    <p>
     Among the Shiʿah the passion play (
     <e type="italic">

     ) was regularly performed, by both professional and amateur actors. The performance always took place during the first 10 days of the month of Muḥarram (the first in the Muslim year), the period when the suffering and death of the descendants and relatives of the fourth caliph
     <xref articleid="5712">

      Mime shows
     </title>
     <p>
      In the medieval Muslim theatre, mime shows aimed to entertain rather than to uplift their audiences. Regrettably, few mime shows were recorded in writing, and those that were recorded were set down primarily to serve as guidelines for directors, who might tamper with the wording, as in the improvisation of the Italian
      <xref articleid="24948">
       commedia dell’arte

      . Some plays were on historical themes, but preference was for comedies or farces with an erotic flavour. The audience was largely composed of the poor and uneducated.

      (imitator) in Turkish, the mimic had many similarities to his Classical Greek forerunners. Basically, he was a storyteller who used mimicry as a comic element, designed to appeal to his largely uneducated audience. By gesture and word he would imitate animals, birds, or local dialects; he was very popular in Arabic- and Turkish-speaking areas. Even today he has not been wholly supplanted in the Islamic world by literacy or by such modern entertainments as radio, television, and the cinema. Sometimes several

      companies of actors, who consequently became generally accepted; also some were retained by the princes of the Romanian principalities under Ottoman rule. The fact that they continued to enjoy popularity to World War I may be explained by their simple dramatic appeal, which was coupled with sharp satire of the well-to-do and the ruling classes (but hardly ever of Islam). This irreverence frequently resulted in fines and imprisonment for the actors, but it never produced a basic change of style.

There was no stage, and props were simple: they generally comprised a table or movable screen, while other objects were represented by paintings glued on paper. An orchestra of about four musicians enlivened the show and gave the performers, who were all male, their cues. Roles were generally stereotyped, with stock characters, such as a dandy, the foreign physician, and regional types (Kurds, Albanians, Armenians, Arabs, and Jews) quarreling and fighting in

      On the other hand, the shadow play had been widely popular for many centuries in Turkish- or Arabic-speaking countries. Its essence, like that of the mime shows, was entertainment without moral import, and few plays were recorded in writing beyond a sketch of the action. Most were comedies and farces that were performed for the enjoyment of an audience that was, for the most part, very poor and uneducated.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Turkey the Karagöz (a character whose name means “black-eye”) theatre was the prevalent form of shadow play. This art apparently came from China or perhaps from Southeast Asia, as the French term
      <e type="italic">
       ombres chinoises
      </e>
      indeed hints, though the prevailing element of the grotesque was probably inherited from ancient Greece by way of Byzantium. The Karagöz was well known in Turkey during the 16th century but was so fully developed that it must have been introduced much earlier, and it quickly spread from Syria to North Africa and the Greek islands. Its performers were in great demand at the sultan’s court as well as elsewhere, and they soon organized their own guild. Since only the framework of the play was sketched in writing, there was scope for a great deal of impromptu wit, and Karagöz shows, like the
      <e type="italic">
       ortaoyunu
      </e>
      , were inevitably satirical. But with the coming of motion pictures the Karagöz declined, and performances are now mostly confined to the month of Ramadan.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the traditional performance of the Karagöz, the stage is separated from the audience by a frame holding a sheet; the latter has shrunk over the years from about 6 by 7.5 feet (1.8 by 2.3 metres) to about 3 by 2 feet (0.9 by 0.6 metre). The puppets, which are flat and made of leather, are controlled by the puppeteers with rods and are placed behind the screen. An oil lamp is then placed still farther back so that it will throw the puppets’ shadows onto the screen.
     </p>
     <p>
      A standard shadow play has three main elements: introduction, dialogue, and plot. The introduction is fairly stereotyped and consists of an argument and usually a quarrel between Karagöz and Hacivat, the two most common characters. The former is a simple, commonsense fellow, while the latter is more formal and polished, if shallow and pedantic. The dialogue between the two varies with the occasion but always contains impromptu repartee, though most puppet masters have at least 28 different plots in stock—a different one for each night of Ramadan. Some are historical, many ribald, but all are popular entertainment. Additional characters or animals may be introduced, calling for great skill on the part of the puppet master and his assistant in manipulating several simultaneously as well as in reciting the text in changing tones and playing music. Some have one or two musicians to help.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mimicry and caricature, while essential to both the
      <e type="italic">
       meddah
      </e>
      and the
      <e type="italic">
       ortaoyunu
      </e>
      , are technically more developed in the shadow play. Here entire productions are based on a
      <xref articleid="50579">
       comedy of manners
      </xref>
      or of character. In addition to the stock characters from various ethnic groups, there are, for example, the drug addict who wraps his narcotic in dissolving gum before the fast begins so as not to sin, the light-headed Turk (“he who eats his inheritance”) who is a prodigal and a debauchee, the highway robber, the stutterer, and the policeman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Karagöz is the most frequently performed but not the sole type of shadow play in Muslim countries. In Egypt a shadow theatre is known to have existed as early as the 13th century, long before records of Karagöz shows were kept in Turkey. A physician, Muḥammad ibn Dāniyāl, wrote three shadow plays that have survived. They were performed in the 13th century and display humour and satire and the lampooning of matchmaking and marriage. These plays also introduce a parade of popular contemporary characters, many of whom earn their living in shady or amusing trades. A positively phallic element is as evident here as it is in the Karagöz.

      Iranian popular theatre
     </title>
     <p>
      Popular theatre existed among the Iranians, who were proud of a long-lived cultural tradition and preserved their national language under Arab domination; indeed, even their branch of Islam, Shiʿism, set them apart from the Sunni majority. The Ottomans’ failure to conquer Iran increased competition between the respective intellectual elites. Iran had inherited a considerable theatrical tradition from pre-Islamic times, and it is not surprising that a popular comic theatre flourished there. The central figure of this type of theatre was the
      <e type="italic">
       katchal pahlavān
      </e>
      (“bald actor”), and mimicry was important, both in comedy and in pantomime. The
      <e type="italic">
       baqqal-bāzī
      </e>
      (“grocer play”), in which a grocer repeatedly quarrels with his good-for-nothing servant, is a typical example of the popular comic tradition. The marionette theatre, or
      <e type="italic">
       lobet-bāzī
      </e>
      , while using Iranian puppets, was similar to its Turkish counterpart. At least five puppets appeared, and singing was an integral part of a production that sometimes resembled Italian and French puppet shows. The

      , particularly in the region of
      <xref articleid="108701">

      )

     <p>
      Quite different was the passion play, derived mainly from early Islamic lore and assembled as a sequence of tragedies representing Shiʿi martyrdom. Both the shadow play and the passion play were interlarded with musical prologues, accompaniment, and interludes, but these were not necessarily an integral part, serving rather to create a mood.
     </p>
     <p>
      A preoccupation with religion is characteristic of Persian theatrical performances, and, during the first 10 days of the month of Muḥarram, the martyrdom of ʿAlī’s descendants at the hands of the
      <xref articleid="74193">
       Umayyads
      </xref>
      is reenacted. Although these shows are also performed among Shiʿi Turks in Central Asia and Shiʿi Arab communities in Iraq and elsewhere, Iran is their centre. Some plays are satirical, directed against wrongdoers, but most form a set of tragedies, performed as passion plays on those 10 successive days. Named
      <e type="italic">
       taʿziyyah
      </e>
      , (“consolation”), this type of drama is an expression of Persian patriotism and, above all, of piety, both elements combining in an expression of the national religion, Shiʿism.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to understand the mood of the
      <e type="italic">
       taʿziyyah
      </e>
      , it is necessary to remember that storytellers in Iran recite the gruesome details of the martyrdom of Ḥasan, Ḥusayn, and other descendants of ʿAlī all year long. Thus prepared, people swell the street processions during the days of Muḥarram, chain themselves, flagellate their bodies, and pierce their limbs with needles, shouting in unison and carrying images of the martyrs—made of straw and covered with blood—contrary to the injunctions of Islam. Sometimes men walk in the processions with heads hidden and collars bloodied, all part of a pageant dating from the 9th or 10th century. Its peak is reached daily in the play describing the martyrdom of ʿAlī’s family and entourage, which used to be presented in the large mosques but, when the mosques proved too small, was given a special place. The roles of reciter of the martyrdom and of participant in a procession have blended over the years to produce the
      <e type="italic">
       taʿziyyah
      </e>
      play, in which the reciters march in procession to the appointed place and there recite their pieces, which can be considered as a prologue before the play itself begins.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chief incidents narrated in the
      <e type="italic">
       taʿziyyah
      </e>
      are not necessarily presented in chronological order, but in any case the
      <e type="italic">
       taʿziyyah
      </e>
      texts (manuscripts from the 17th and 18th centuries, thenceforth, printed texts) give an inadequate impression of their forceful effect. Indeed, the audience identifies itself so closely with the play that foreigners have, on occasion, been manhandled. Because half of the actors play the supporters of the ʿAlids and half play their opponents, the latter are sometimes attacked and beaten at the end of the play. The decor too is half realistic and half symbolic: blood is real, yet sand is represented by straw. The stage effects are frequently overdone, and this clearly further excites the audience. For instance, Ḥusayn’s gory head is made to recite holy verses, or an armless warrior is seen to kill his opponent with a sword he holds in his teeth. The horses are real, although most of the other animals are played by humans. In general, the actors, though chiefly nonprofessional, infect the audience with their enthusiasm and absorption.

     Insofar as dance is related to the modern theatre, there is little difference between Muslim production and its European or American counterpart. Dance and drama are combined according to the artistic needs of the production or the personal tastes of the producer and director. Perhaps more important is the dance itself, independently performed as artistic self-expression. The geographical centre of folk dance is in the area east of the Mediterranean, though remnants of other cultures have survived. There are Balkan traces in western and northern Turkey, for example, and Amazigh and even sub-Saharan African traces in Morocco and elsewhere in North Africa.

      (sectarian Arab communities located in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel) are very fond of it. The performers dance in a straight line, holding handkerchiefs high in the air, while the first dancer in the row gives the sign for stepping or jumping. Among the Bedouin almost any pretext suffices for dancing, although, since the mid-20th century, dancing has been practiced most often at weddings and similar festivities. Usually two male dancers, or two rows of male dancers, repeatedly advance toward each other or the audience and retire. Of this basic figure there are numerous variations that give the different dances their names.

      The Turks are also lovers of music and dance and frequently sing and dance when they meet. There is no single national dance popular throughout the country; dances vary in the numbers required, some being for solo performance, others designed for pairs or groups, though nearly all have instrumental accompaniment. As illustration of the possibilities of a basic step, there are at least 40 variations of the group dance known as

Until it was closed in 1979, the Iranian ballet company was outstanding in the Muslim world, drawing on ancient war dances, fire-priest dances, dervish dances, and tribal folklore as well as on scenes and decor from painting, sculpture, and the rich imagery of classical Persian poetry. Various folk dances are likewise performed all over Iran; they are accompanied by music and reflect local traditions and customs. Some are mimetic, others erotic, others, again, war dances (chiefly in the mountain areas) and comic dances (usually with

      Contemporary Arabic theatre owes much to the imaginative daring of the Naqqāsh family in 19th-century Beirut, which was then under Turkish rule. Significantly, they were Christians, then better-educated and more cosmopolitan than Muslims, and they had the advantages of Beirut’s contacts with Europe and position as the headquarters of missionary activity. A Beirut

He did so before a select audience of foreign dignitaries and local notables, and he wrote his play in colloquial Arabic and revised the plot to suit the taste and views of his audience. Further, he changed the locale to an Arab town and Arabicized the names of the participants. Other touches included instrumental and vocal music and the playing of women’s roles by men, in the traditional manner. The above features characterized the Arabic theatre for about half a century. Al-Naqqāsh, together with his family, composed and presented two other musical plays, one based on Molière’s

Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals and actors emigrated there, particularly after the anti-Christian riots of 1860 in Syria. Though a somewhat crippled Arabic theatre continued in Syria, its influence was carried into Egypt by émigrés and later spread to other Arabic-speaking regions. The number of theatres, a potentially large public, the munificence of Egypt’s rulers, increasing prosperity under British rule after 1882, and increasing education soon made Egypt the centre of Arabic theatre, a position it has successfully maintained since.
     </p>
     <p>
      The colloquial Arabic of Egypt was increasingly employed in the theatre, and several companies toured the country and neighbouring parts. The composition of those companies was fluid, for the actors were prone to be fickle in their loyalties. Nevertheless, certain types of Egyptian theatre can be discerned in the late 19th century and during the early 20th. Some, like the company of Salāmah Ḥijāzī, used music to such an extent that their productions approached being labelled
      <xref articleid="110141">
       opera
      </xref>
      or
      <xref articleid="57193">
       operetta
      </xref>
      . Others, like that of ʿAlī al-Kassār, specialized in downright farce, expressed in revue form, with a Nubian hero, the “Barbarin,” who made a specialty of ridicule and mimicry. Yet others, like the company of Najīb al-Rīḥānī, oscillating between outright farce and comedy, skillfully depicted contemporary Egyptian manners; in particular, Najīb al-Rīḥānī created a character called Kish-Kish Bey, whose misadventures and unsolicited advice on every subject made him a classic creation. A conventional theatre sprang up in Egypt too, catering to a growing number of intellectuals and presenting dramas and tragedies in polished, literary Arabic. Its chief exponent was Jūrj Abyaḍ, who had spent time studying acting in Paris. In contrast, Yūsuf Wahbī’s National Troupe performed realistic plays, usually dramas or melodramas, using either colloquial or literary Arabic and sometimes a combination of both.
     </p>
     <p>
      The plays performed by the Egyptian troupes and others in Arabic-speaking lands developed through three overlapping but distinguishable stages: adaptations, translations, and original plays. Adaptations came first in the 19th century (
      <e type="italic">
       see above
      </e>
      ). Translations of established works appealed to a discriminating public, but original plays, part of the evolution of modern Arabic literature, reflected a growing interest in political and social problems. The decline of foreign influence and the arrival of political independence encouraged creativity, which, however much under European influence, has some original works to its credit. Two 20th-century Arabic playwrights, both Egyptian, were

      The development of the modern Turkish theatre strongly resembles its Arabic counterpart. In Istanbul, theatrical performances were not unusual among the diplomatic and international set, and some local Turks were acquainted with them. Nonetheless, Turkish plays for live actors—barring
      <e type="italic">
       ortaoyunu
      </e>
      —date only from 1839. The first Turkish playhouse was built in Pera (now Beyoğlu), significantly in the middle of the foreign and embassy quarter of Istanbul. Many of the actors were members of non-Muslim minorities, such as Armenians, and the first plays presented in Turkish were adaptations from the French, chiefly Molière. They were done during the 1840s, when music was an important item.

     <p>
      The Gedik Paşa Theatre, named for the area in Istanbul where it was located, was the first theatre in which Turkish plays were produced by native actors speaking in Turkish. The actors received a salary, and local writers presented their own plays. Originally built for foreign companies, the theatre was reconstructed in 1867 and reopened in 1868 for a Turkish company headed by an Armenian, Agop, who was later converted to Islam and changed his name to Yakup. For almost 20 years the Gedik Paşa Theatre was the dramatic centre of the city. Plays in translation were soon followed by original plays, several with a nationalist appeal, such as Namık Kemal’s
      <e type="italic">

      (“Fatherland”), which was first produced in 1873. The actors had to struggle against prejudice and the playwrights against

      (some of them were imprisoned or exiled), but the Turkish theatre spread beyond Istanbul in the 1870s and ’80s to such places as Adana (in southern Anatolia) and Bursa (just south of Istanbul, across the

      of 1908, censorship was not relaxed, but interest in the theatre grew, particularly over political matters, and plays about the new constitution were written and performed. After the foundation of the Turkish republic in 1923, the state subsidized several theatre companies and a school for dramatic arts, and an opera house was built in Ankara. Official support not only gave financial encouragement but also implied a change of attitude over such matters as the participation of Muslim women in productions.

     <p>
      By the middle of the 20th century, theatrical life was mostly centred on Istanbul and Ankara, although theatres and companies continued in the small towns too. A growing number of original plays, some of which were influenced by American literature, have been written and produced; the standard has been higher than it was before World War I, when Turkish poetry and fiction were rather more impressive than the drama. Subjects, too, have been more diverse since that time. To topics such as the position of women, marriage and divorce, and the character of Islamic institutions—all popular under the Ottomans—have been added the

      , education, village conditions, secularization, class struggle, and psychological problems. The Dormen Theatre was founded in Istanbul in 1955 by Haldun Dormen; in the 1971 World Theatre season in London the company performed

      In Iran the birth of the modern theatre dates from the second half of the 19th century. Adaptations and translations from European plays appeared in Persian, often with the location and names suited to Iran. Molière again was a favourite and western European influence considerable, though

      Playwrights began to write original plays almost at once; one of the earliest playwrights was an Azerbaijani, named Akhundof, living in the Caucasus.

Other plays likewise showed pronounced yearnings for social reform presented in a satirical style; some of those were published in a magazine called

   Visual arts
  </title>
  <p>
   In order to answer whether there is an aesthetic, iconographic, or stylistic unity to the visually perceptible arts of Islamic peoples, it is first essential to realize that no ethnic or geographical entity was Muslim from the beginning. There is no Islamic art, therefore, in the way there is a Chinese art or a French art. Nor is it simply a period art, like Gothic art or Baroque art, for once a land or an ethnic entity became Muslim, it remained Muslim, a small number of exceptions such as Spain or Sicily notwithstanding. Political and social events transformed a number of lands with a variety of earlier histories into Muslim lands. But because early Islam as such did not possess or propagate an art of its own, each area could continue, in fact often did continue, whatever modes of creativity it had acquired. It may then not be appropriate at all to talk about the visual arts of Islamic peoples, and one should instead consider separately each of the areas that became Muslim: Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Iran, Anatolia, and India. Such, in fact, has been the direction taken by some scholarship. Even though tainted at times with parochial nationalism, that approach has been useful in that it has focused attention on a number of permanent features in different regions of Islamic lands that are older than and independent from the faith itself and from the political entity created by it. Iranian art, in particular, exhibits a number of features (certain themes such as the representation of birds or an epic tradition in painting) that owe little to its Islamic character since the 7th century. Ottoman art shares a Mediterranean tradition of architectural conception with Italy rather than with the rest of the Muslim world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Such examples can easily be multiplied, but it is probably wrong to overstate their importance. For if one looks at the art of Islamic lands from a different perspective, a totally different picture emerges. The perspective is that of the lands that surround the Muslim world or of the times that preceded its formation. For even if there are ambiguous examples, most observers can recognize a flavour, a mood in Islamic visual arts that is distinguishable from what is known in East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) or in the Christian West. This mood or flavour has been called decorative, for it seems at first glance to emphasize an immense complexity of surface effects without apparent meanings attached to the visible motifs. But it has other characteristics as well: it is often colourful, both in architecture and in objects; it avoids representations of living things; it gives much prominence to the work of artisans and counts among its masterpieces not merely works of architecture or of painting but also the creations of weavers, potters, and metalworkers. The problem is whether these uniquenesses of Islamic art, when compared with other artistic traditions, are the result of the nature of Islam or of some other factor or series of factors.
  </p>
  <p>
   These preliminary remarks suggest at the very outset the main epistemological peculiarity of Islamic art: it consists of a large number of quite disparate traditions that, when seen all together, appear distinguishable from what surrounded them and from what preceded them through a series of stylistic and thematic characteristics. The key question is how this was possible, but no answer can be given before the tradition itself has been properly defined.
  </p>
  <p>
   Such a definition can be provided only in history, through an examination of the formation and development of the arts through the centuries, for a static sudden phenomenon is not being dealt with, but rather a slow building up of a visual language of forms with many dialects and with many changes. Whether these complexities of growth and development subsumed a common structure is the challenging question facing the historian of this artistic tradition. What makes the question particularly difficult to answer is that the study of Islamic art is still so new. Many monuments are unpublished or at least insufficiently known, and only a handful of scientific excavations have investigated the physical setting of the culture and of its art. Much, therefore, remains tentative in the knowledge and appreciation of works of Islamic art, and what follows is primarily an outline of what is known, with a number of suggestions for further work into insufficiently investigated areas.

   Each artistic tradition has tended to develop its own favourite mediums and techniques. Some, of course, such as architecture, are automatic needs of every culture; and, for reasons to be developed later, it is in the medium of architecture that some of the most characteristically Islamic works of art are found. Other techniques, on the other hand, acquire varying forms and emphases. Sculpture in the round hardly existed as a major art form, and, although such was also the case of all Mediterranean arts at the time of Islam’s growth, one does not encounter the astounding rebirth of sculpture that occurred in the West. Wall painting existed but has generally been poorly preserved; the great Islamic art of painting was limited to the illustration of books. The unique feature of Islamic techniques is the astounding development taken by the so-called decorative arts—e.g., woodwork, glass, ceramics, metalwork, and textiles. New techniques were invented and spread throughout the Muslim world—at times even beyond its frontiers. In dealing with Islam, therefore, it is quite incorrect to think of those techniques as the “minor” arts, for the amount and intensity of creative energies spent on the decorative arts transformed them into major artistic forms, and their significance in defining a profile of the aesthetic and visual language of Islamic peoples is far greater than in the instances of many other cultures. Furthermore, because, for a variety of reasons to be discussed later, the Muslim world did not develop until quite late the notion of “noble” arts, the decorative arts have reflected far better the needs and ambitions of the culture as a whole. The kind of conclusion that can be reached about Islamic civilization through its visual arts thus extends far deeper than is usual in the study of an artistic tradition, and it requires a combination of archaeological, art-historical, and textual information.
  </p>
  <p>
   An example may suffice to demonstrate the point. Among all the techniques of Islamic visual arts, the most important one was the art of textiles. Textiles, of course, were used for daily wear at all social levels and for all occasions. But clothes were also the main indicators of rank, and they were given as rewards or as souvenirs by princes, high and low. They were a major status symbol, and their manufacture and distribution were carefully controlled through a complicated institution known as the
   <e type="italic">
    ṭirāz
   </e>
   . Major events were at times celebrated by being depicted on silks. Many texts have been identified that describe the hundreds of different kinds of textiles that existed. Because textiles could easily be moved, they became a vehicle for the transmission of artistic themes within the Muslim world and beyond its frontiers. In the case of this one technique, therefore, one is dealing not simply with a medium of the decorative arts but with a key medium in the definition of a given time’s taste, of its practical functions, and of the ways in which its ideas were distributed. The more unfortunate point is that the thousands of fragments that have remained have not yet been studied in a sufficiently systematic way, and in only a handful of instances has it been possible to relate individual fragments to known texts. When more work has been completed, however, a study of this one medium should contribute significantly to the commercial, social, and aesthetic history of Islam, as well as explain much of the impact that Islamic art had beyond the frontiers of the Muslim world.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following survey of Islamic visual arts, therefore, will be primarily a historical one, for it is in development through time that the main achievements of Islamic art can best be understood. At the same time, other features peculiar to this tradition will be kept in mind: the varying importance of different lands, each of which had identifiable artistic features of its own, and the uniqueness of certain creative techniques.

    Origins

    <title>
     Earlier artistic traditions
    </title>
    <p>
     Islamic visual arts were created by the confluence of two entirely separate kinds of phenomena: a number of earlier artistic traditions and a new faith. The arts inherited by Islam were of extraordinary technical virtuosity and stylistic or iconographic variety. All the developments of arcuated and vaulted architecture that had taken place in Iran and in the Roman Empire were available in their countless local variants. Stone, baked brick, mud brick, and wood existed as mediums of construction, and all the complicated engineering systems developed particularly in the Roman Empire were still utilized from Spain to the Euphrates. All the major techniques of decoration were still used, except for monumental sculpture. In secular and in religious art, a more or less formally accepted equivalence between representation and represented subject had been established. Technically, therefore, as well as ideologically, the Muslim world took over an extremely sophisticated system of visual forms; and, because the Muslim conquest was accompanied by a minimum of destruction, all the monuments, and especially the attitudes attached to them, were passed on to the new culture.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second point about the pre-Islamic traditions is the almost total absence of anything from Arabia itself. While archaeological work in the peninsula may modify this conclusion in part, it does seem that Islamic art formed itself entirely in some sort of relationship to non-Arab traditions. Even the rather sophisticated art created in earlier times by the
     <xref articleid="58157">

     </xref>
     or by the
     <xref articleid="54597">

     had almost no impact on Islamic art, and the

     <xref articleid="109828">
      Mecca
     </xref>
     , the only pre-Islamic sanctuary maintained by the new faith, remained as a unique monument that was almost never copied or imitated despite its immense religious significance. The pre-Islamic sources of Islamic art are thus entirely extraneous to the milieu in which the new faith was created. In this respect the visual arts differ considerably from most other aspects of Islamic culture.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is not to say that there was no impact of the new faith on the arts, but to a large extent it was an incidental impact, the result of the existence of a new social and political entity rather than of a doctrine. Earliest Islam as seen in the
     <xref articleid="105854">
      Qurʾān
     </xref>
     or in the more verifiable accounts of
     <xref articleid="105853">
      the Prophet
     </xref>
     ’s life simply do not deal with the arts, either on the practical level of requiring or suggesting forms as expressions of the culture or on the ideological level of defining a Muslim attitude toward images. In all instances, concrete Qurʾānic passages later used for the arts had their visual significance extrapolated.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no prohibition against representations of living things, and not a single Qurʾānic passage refers clearly to the
     <xref articleid="53913">
      mosque
     </xref>
     , eventually to become the most characteristically Muslim religious building. In the simple, practical, and puritanical milieu of early Islam, aesthetic or visual questions simply did not arise.

   </h3>
   <h3 id="h61830">
    <title>
     The mosque
    </title>
    <p>
     The impact of the faith on the arts occurred rather as the fledgling culture encountered the earlier non-Islamic world and sought to justify its own acceptance or rejection of new ways and attitudes. The discussion of two examples of particular significance illustrates the point. One is the case of the mosque. The word itself derives from the Arabic
     <e type="italic">
      masjid
     </e>
     , “a place where one prostrates oneself (in front of God).” It was a common term in pre-Islamic Arabic and in the Qurʾān, where it is applied to sanctuaries in general without restriction. If a more concrete significance was meant, the word was used in construct with some other term, as in
     <e type="italic">
      masjid al-ḥaram
     </e>
     to refer to the Meccan sanctuary. There was no need in earliest times for a uniquely Muslim building, for any place could be used for private prayer as long as the correct direction (
     <e type="italic">
      qiblah
     </e>
     , originally
     <xref articleid="106455">
      Jerusalem
     </xref>
     but very soon Mecca) was observed and the proper sequence of gestures and pious statements was followed. In addition to private prayer, which had no formal setting, Islam instituted a collective prayer on Fridays, where the same ritual was accompanied by a sermon from the imam (leader of prayer, originally the Prophet, then his successors, and later legally any able-bodied Muslim) and by the more complex ceremony of the
     <e type="italic">
      khuṭbah
     </e>
     , a collective swearing of allegiance to the community’s leadership. This ceremony served to strengthen the common bond between all members of the
     <e type="italic">
      ummah
     </e>
     , the Muslim “collectivity,” and its importance in creating and maintaining the unity of early Islam has often been emphasized. There were two traditional locales for this event in the Prophet’s time. One was his private house, whose descriptions have been preserved; it was a large open space with private rooms on one side and rows of palm trunks making a colonnade on two other sides, the deeper colonnade being on the side of the
     <e type="italic">
      qiblah
     </e>
     . The Prophet’s house was not a sanctuary but simply the most convenient place for the early community to gather. Far less is known about the second place of gathering for the Muslim community. It was used primarily on major feast days, such as the end of the fasting period or the feast of sacrifice. It was called a
     <e type="italic">
      muṣallā
     </e>
     , literally “a place for prayer,” and
     <e type="italic">
      muṣallā
     </e>
     s were usually located outside city walls. Nothing is known about the shape taken by
     <e type="italic">
      muṣallā
     </e>
     s, but in all probability they were as simple as pre-Islamic pagan sanctuaries: large enclosures surrounded by a wall and devoid of any architectural or ornamental feature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Altogether then there was hardly anything that could be identified as a holy building or as an architectural form. To be complete, one should add two additional features. One is an action, the call to prayer (
     <xref articleid="3726">
      <e type="italic">
       adhān
      </e>
     </xref>
     ). It became, fairly rapidly, a formal moment preceding the gathering of the faithful. One man would climb on the roof and proclaim that God is great and that men must congregate to pray. There was no formal monument attached to the ceremony, though it led eventually to the ubiquitous
     <xref articleid="52803">
      minaret
     </xref>
     . The other early feature was an actual structure. It was the
     <e type="italic">
      minbar
     </e>
     , a chair with several steps on which the Prophet would climb in order to preach. The monument itself had a pre-Islamic origin, but Muhammad transformed it into a characteristically Muslim form.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the exception of the
     <e type="italic">
      minbar
     </e>
     , only a series of actions were formulated in early Islamic times. There were no forms attached to them, nor were any needed. But, as the Muslim world grew in size, the contact with many other cultures brought about two developments. On the one hand, there were thousands of examples of beautiful religious buildings that impressed the conquering Arabs. But, more important, the need arose to preserve the restricted uniqueness of the community of faithful and to express its separateness from other groups. Islamic religious architecture began with this need and, in ways to be described later, created a formal setting for the activities, ceremonies, and ideas that had been formless at the outset.
    </p>

   <h3 id="h61831">
    <title>
     The prohibition against images
    </title>
    <p>
     A second and closely parallel development of the impact of the Islamic religion on the visual arts is the celebrated question of a Muslim iconoclasm. As has already been mentioned, the Qurʾān does not utter a word for or against the representation of living things. It is equally true that from about the middle of the 8th century a prohibition had been formally stated, and thenceforth it would be a standard feature of Islamic thought, even though the form in which it is expressed has varied from absolute to partial and even though it has never been totally followed. The justification for the prohibition tended to be that any representation of a living thing was an act of competition with God, for he alone can create something that is alive. It is striking that this theological explanation reflects the state of the arts in the Christian world at the time of the Muslim conquest—a period of
     <xref articleid="106111" refid="h9243">
      iconoclastic controversy
     </xref>
     . It may thus be suggested that Islam developed an attitude toward images as it came into contact with other cultures and that its attitude was negative because the arts of the time appeared to lead easily to dreaded idolatry. While it is only by the middle of the 8th century that there is actual proof of the existence of a Muslim doctrine, it is likely that, more or less intuitively, the Muslims felt a certain reluctance toward representations from the very beginning. For all monuments of religious art are devoid of any representations; even a number of attempts at representational symbolism in the official art of
     <xref articleid="472065">

     </xref>
     were soon abandoned.

     <assemblyref assemblyid="a228951"/>
     This rapid crystallization of Islamic attitudes toward images has considerable significance. For practical purposes, representations are not found in religious art, although matters are quite different in secular art. Instead there occurred very soon a replacement of imagery with
     <xref articleid="110482" refid="h53194">
      calligraphy
     </xref>
     and the concomitant transformation of calligraphy into a major artistic medium. Furthermore, the world of Islam tended to seek means of representing the holy other than by images of human beings, and one of the main problems of interpretation of Islamic art is that of the degree of means it achieved in this search. But there is a deeper aspect to this rejection of holy images. Although the generally Semitic or specifically Jewish sources that have been given to Islamic iconoclasms have probably been exaggerated, the reluctance imposed by the circumstances of the 7th century transformed into a major key of artistic creativity the magical fear of visual imagery that exists in all cultures but that is usually relegated to a secondary level. This uniqueness is certainly one of the main causes of the abstract tendencies that are among the great glories of the tradition. Even when a major art of painting did develop, it remained always somehow secondary to the mainstream of the culture’s development.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both in the case of the religious building and in that of the representations, therefore, it was the contact with pre-Islamic cultures in Muslim-conquered areas that compelled Islam to transform its practical and unique needs into monuments and to seek within itself for intellectual and theological justifications for its own instincts. The great strength of early Islam was that it possessed within itself the ideological means to put together a visual expression of its own, even though it did not develop at the very beginning a need for such an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     One last point can be made about the origins of Islamic art. It concerns the degree of importance taken by the various artistic and cultural entities conquered by the Arabs in the 7th and 8th centuries, for the early empire had gathered in regions that had not been politically or even ideologically related for centuries. During the first century or two of Islam, the main models and the main sources of inspiration were certainly the Christian centres around the Mediterranean. But the failure to capture Constantinople (now
     <xref articleid="106446">
      Istanbul
     </xref>
     ) and to destroy the
     <xref articleid="106111">
      Byzantine Empire
     </xref>
     also made those Christian centres inimical competitors, whereas the whole world of
     <xref articleid="106324">
      Iran
     </xref>
     became an integral part of the empire, even though the conquering Arabs were far less familiar with the latter than with the former. A much more complex problem is posed by conversions, for it is through the success of the militant Muslim religious mission that the culture expanded so rapidly. Insofar as one can judge, it is the common folk, primarily in cities, who took over the new faith most rapidly; and there thus was added in early Islamic culture a folk element whose impact may have been larger than has hitherto been imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those preliminary considerations on the origins of Islamic art have made it possible to outline several of the themes and problems that remained constant features of the tradition: a self-conscious sense of uniqueness when compared with others; a continuous reference to its own Qurʾānic sources; a constant relationship to many different cultures; a folk element; and a variety of regional developments. None of those features remained constant, not even those aspects of the faith that affected the arts. But while they changed, the fact of their existence, their structural presence, remained a constant of Islamic art.

    Early period: the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties
   </title>
   <p>
    Of all the recognizable periods of Islamic art, this is by far the most difficult one to explain properly, even though it is quite well documented. There are two reasons for this difficulty. On the one hand, it was a formative period, a time when new forms were created that identify the aesthetic and practical ideals of the new culture. Such periods are difficult to define when, as in the case of Islam, there was no artistic need inherent to the culture itself. The second complication derives from the fact that Muslim conquest hardly ever destroyed former civilizations with its own established creativity. Material culture, therefore, continued as before, and archaeologically it is almost impossible to distinguish between pre-Islamic and early Islamic artifacts. Paradoxical though it may sound, there is an early Islamic Christian art of Syria and Egypt, and in many other regions the parallel existence of a Muslim and a non-Muslim art continued for centuries. What did happen during early Islamic times, however, was the establishment of a dominant new taste, and it is the nature and character of this taste that has to be explained. It occurred first in Syria and Iraq, the two areas with the largest influx of Muslims and with the two successive capitals of the empire,
    <xref articleid="110115" refid="h25659">
     Damascus
    </xref>
    under the Umayyads and
    <xref articleid="109394" refid="h24885">
     Baghdad
    </xref>
    under the early Abbasids. From Syria and Iraq this new taste spread in all directions and adapted itself to local conditions and local materials, thus creating considerable regional and chronological variations in early Islamic art.
   </p>
   <p>
    From a historical point of view, two major dynasties are involved. One is the
    <xref articleid="74193">
     Umayyad dynasty
    </xref>
    , which ruled from 661 to 750 and whose monuments are datable from 680 to 745. It was the only Muslim dynasty ever to control the whole of the Islamic-conquered world. The second dynasty is the
    <xref articleid="3236">
     Abbasid dynasty
    </xref>
    ; technically its rule extended as late as 1258, but in reality its princes ceased to be a significant cultural factor after the second decade of the 10th century. The Abbasids no longer controlled
    <xref articleid="108580">
     Spain
    </xref>
    , where an independent Umayyad caliphate had been established (
    <e type="italic">

    <xref articleid="106015" refid="h22356">
     Egypt
    </xref>
    as well as in northeastern
    <xref articleid="106324">
     Iran
    </xref>
    a number of more or less independent dynasties appeared, such as the
    <xref articleid="73737">
     Ṭūlūnids
    </xref>
    or the
    <xref articleid="65183">
     Samanids
    </xref>
    . Although research in the late 20th century tended to make the conclusion less certain than it used to be for the Samanids and northeast Iran, the initial impulse for the artistic creativity of those dynasties came from the main Abbasid centres in Iraq. While in detailed studies it is possible to distinguish between Umayyad and Abbasid art or between the arts of various provinces, the key features of the first three centuries of Islamic art (roughly through the middle of the 10th century) are the interplay between local or imperial impulses and the creation of new forms and functions.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is possible to study those centuries as a succession of clusters of monuments, but, because there are so many of them, a study can easily end up as an endless list. It is preferable, therefore, to centre the discussion of Umayyad and Abbasid monuments on the functional and morphological characteristics that identify the new Muslim world and only secondarily be concerned with stylistic progression or regional differences.

      The one obviously new function developed during this period is that of the mosque, or
      <e type="italic">
       masjid
      </e>
      . The earliest adherents of Islam used the private house of the Prophet in Medina as the main place for their religious and other activities and

      <e type="italic">
       masjid
      </e>
      s in every centre taken over by the new faith. These were not simply or even primarily religious centres. They were rather the community centres of the faithful, in which all social, political, educational, and individual affairs were transacted. Among those activities were common prayer and the ceremony of the
      <xref articleid="45358">
       <e type="italic">
        khuṭbah
       </e>
      </xref>
      . The first mosques were built primarily to serve as the restricted space in which the new community would make its own collective decisions. It is there that the treasury of the community was kept, and early accounts are full of anecdotes about the immense variety of events, from the dramatic to the scabrous, that took place in mosques. Since even in earliest times the Muslim community consisted of several superimposed and interconnected social systems, mosques reflected this complexity, and, next to large mosques for the whole community, tribal mosques and mosques for various quarters of a town or city are also known.
     </p>
     <p>
      None of those early mosques has survived, and no descriptions of the smaller ones have been preserved. There do remain, however, accurate textual descriptions of the large congregational buildings erected at
      <xref articleid="46361">
       Kūfah
      </xref>
      and
      <xref articleid="13649">

      in Iraq and at
      <xref articleid="35717">
       Al-Fusṭāṭ
      </xref>
      in Egypt. At Kūfah a larger square was marked out by a ditch, and a covered colonnade known as a
      <e type="italic">
       ẓullah
      </e>
      (a shady place) was put up on the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      side. In 670 a wall pierced by many doors was built in place of the ditch, and colonnades were put up on all four sides, with a deeper one on the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      . In all probability the Basra mosque was very similar, and only minor differences distinguished the ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ mosque at Al-Fusṭāṭ. Much has been written about the sources of this type of building, but the simplest explanation may be that this is the very rare instance of the actual creation of a new architectural type. The new faith’s requirement for centralization, or a space for a large and constantly growing community, could not be met by any existing architectural form. Almost accidentally, therefore, the new Muslim cities of Iraq created the hypostyle mosque (a building with the roof resting on rows of
      <xref articleid="24899">
       columns
      </xref>
      ). A flexible architectural unit, a hypostyle structure could be square or rectangular and could be increased or diminished in size by the addition or subtraction of columns. The single religious or symbolic feature of the hypostyle mosque was a
      <e type="italic">
       minbar
      </e>
      (a pulpit) for the preacher, and the direction of prayer was indicated by the greater depth of the colonnade on one side of the structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The examples of Kūfah, Basra, and Al-Fusṭāṭ are particularly clear because they were all built in newly created cities. Matters are somewhat more complex when discussing the older urban centres taken over by Muslims. Although it is not possible to generalize with any degree of certainty, two patterns seem to emerge. In some cases, such as Jerusalem and Damascus and perhaps in most cities conquered through formal treaties, the Muslims took for themselves an available unused space and erected on it some shelter. In Jerusalem this space happened to be a particularly holy one—the area of the
      <xref articleid="43565">
       Jewish temple
      </xref>
      built by
      <xref articleid="40191">
       Herod the Great
      </xref>
      , which had been left willfully abandoned and ruined by the triumphant Christian empire. In Damascus it was a section of a huge Roman temple area, on another part of which there was a church dedicated to
      <xref articleid="43819">
       St. John the Baptist
      </xref>
      . Unfortunately, too little is known about other cities to be able to demonstrate that this pattern was a common one. The very same uncertainty surrounds the second pattern, which consisted in forcibly transforming sanctuaries of older faiths into Muslim ones. This was the case at
      <xref articleid="38991">
       Ḥamāh
      </xref>
      in Syria and at Yazd-e Khvāst in Iran, where archaeological proof exists of the change. There are also several literary references to the fact that Christian churches,
      <xref articleid="106002">
       Zoroastrian
      </xref>
      fire temples, and other older abandoned sanctuaries were transformed into mosques. Altogether, however, those instances probably were not too numerous, because in most places the Muslim conquerors were quite eager to preserve local tradition and because few older sanctuaries could easily serve the primary Muslim need of a large centralizing space.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the 50 years that followed the beginning of the Muslim conquest, the mosque, until then a very general concept in Islamic thought, became a definite building reserved for a variety of needs required by the community of faithful in any one settlement. Only in one area, Iraq, did the mosque acquire a unique form of its own, the oriented hypostyle. Neither in Iraq nor elsewhere is there evidence of symbolic or functional components in mosque design. The only exception is that of the
      <e type="italic">
       maqṣūrah
      </e>
      (literally “closed-off space”), an enclosure, probably in wood, built near the centre of the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      wall. Its purpose was to protect the caliph or his replacement, for several attacks against major political figures had taken place. But the
      <e type="italic">
       maqṣūrah

      was never destined to be a constant fixture of mosques, and its typological significance is limited.

      During the rule of the Umayyad prince
      <xref articleid="75934">
       al-Walīd I
      </xref>
      (705–715), a number of complex developments within the Muslim community were crystallized in the construction of three major mosques—at
      <xref articleid="109829">
       Medina
      </xref>
      , Jerusalem, and Damascus. The very choice of those three cities is indicative: the city in which the Muslim state was formed and in which the Prophet was buried; the city held in common holiness by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, to which was rapidly accruing the mystical hagiography surrounding the Prophet’s ascension into heaven; and the ancient city that became the capital of the new Islamic empire. A first and essential component of al-Walīd’s mosques was thus their imperial character; they were to symbolize the permanent establishment of the new faith and of the state that derived from it. They were no longer purely practical shelters but willful monuments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the plans of Al-Aqṣā Mosque in Jerusalem and of the mosque of Medina can be reconstructed with a fair degree of certainty, only the one at Damascus has been preserved with comparatively minor alterations and repairs. In plan the three buildings appear at first glance to be quite different from each other. The Medina mosque was essentially a large hypostyle with a courtyard. The colonnades on all four sides were of varying depth. Al-Aqṣā Mosque consisted of an undetermined number of naves (possibly as many as 15) parallel to each other in a north-south direction. There was no courtyard, because the rest of the huge esplanade of the former Jewish temple served as the open space in front of the building. The Umayyad Mosque of Damascus is a rectangle 515 by 330 feet (157 by 100 metres) whose outer limits and three gates are parts of a Roman temple (a fourth Roman gate on the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      side was blocked). The interior consists of an open space surrounded on three sides by a portico and of a covered space of three equal long naves parallel to the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      wall that are cut in the middle by a perpendicular nave.
     </p>
     <p>
      The three buildings share several important characteristics. They are all large spaces with a multiplicity of internal supports, and although only the Medina mosque is a pure hypostyle, the Jerusalem and Damascus mosques have the flexibility and easy internal communication characteristic of a hypostyle building. All three mosques exhibit a number of distinctive new practical elements and symbolic meanings. Many of those occur in all mosques; others are known in only some of them. The mihrab, for example, appears in all mosques. This is a niche of varying size that tends to be heavily decorated. It occurs in the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      wall, and, in all probability, its purpose was to commemorate the symbolic presence of the Prophet as the first imam, although there are other explanations. It is in Damascus only that the ancient towers of the Roman building were first used as minarets to call the faithful to prayer and to indicate from afar the presence of Islam (initially minarets tended to exist only in predominantly non-Muslim cities). All three mosques are also provided with an axial nave, a wider aisle unit on the axis of the building, which served both as a formal axis for compositional purposes and as a ceremonial one for the prince’s retinue. Finally, all three buildings were heavily decorated with marble, mosaics, and woodwork. At least in the mosque of Damascus, it is further apparent that there was careful concern for the formal composition—a balance between parts that truly makes this mosque a work of art. This is particularly evident in the successful relationship established between the open space of the court and the facade of the covered
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      side.
     </p>
     <p>
      When compared with the first Muslim buildings of Iraq and Egypt, the monuments of al-Walīd are characterized by the growing complexity of their forms, by the appearance of uniquely Muslim symbolic and functional features, and by the quality of their construction. While the dimensions, external appearance, and proportions of any one of them were affected in each case by unique local circumstances, the internal balance between open and covered areas and the multiplicity of simple and flexible supports indicate the permanence of the early hypostyle tradition.

      Either in its simplest form, as in Medina, or in its more-formalized shape, as in Damascus, the hypostyle tradition dominated mosque architecture from 715 to the 10th century. As it occurs at Nīshāpūr (Neyshābūr) in northeastern Iran, Sīrāf in southern Iran,

      <xref articleid="65198">

      Two classic examples of early mosques in the western Islamic world of interest are preserved in Tunisia and Spain. In Kairouan the Great Mosque was built in stages between 836 and 866. Its most striking feature is the formal emphasis on the building’s T-like axis punctuated by two domes, one of which hovers over the earliest preserved ensemble of mihrab,
      <e type="italic">
       minbar
      </e>
      , and
      <e type="italic">
       maqṣūrah
      </e>
      . At Córdoba the earliest section of the Great Mosque was built in 785–786. It consisted simply of 11 naves with a wider central one and a court. It was enlarged twice in length, first between 833 and 855 and again from 961 to 965 (it was in the latter phase that the celebrated
      <e type="italic">
       maqṣūrah
      </e>
      and mihrab, composing one of the great architectural ensembles of early Islamic art, were constructed). Finally, in 987–988 an extension of the mosque was completed to the east that increased its size by almost one-third without destroying its stylistic unity. The constant increases in the size of this mosque are a further illustration of the flexibility of the hypostyle and its adaptability to any spatial requirement. The most memorable aspects of the Córdoba mosque, however, lie in its construction and decoration. The particularly extensive and heavily decorated mihrab area exemplifies a development that started with the Medina mosque and would continue: an emphasis on the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      wall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the hypostyle mosque was the dominant plan, it was not the only one. From very early Islamic times, a fairly large number of aberrant plans also occur. Most of them were built in smaller urban locations or were secondary mosques in larger Muslim cities. It is rather difficult, therefore, to evaluate whether their significance was purely local or they were important for the tradition as a whole. Because a simple type of square subdivided by four piers into nine-domed units occurs at
      <xref articleid="11974">
       Balkh
      </xref>
      in Afghanistan, at Cairo, and at
      <xref articleid="72795">
       Toledo
      </xref>
      , it may be considered a pan-Islamic type. Other types, a single square hall surrounded by an ambulatory, or a single long barrel-vault parallel or perpendicular to the
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      , are rarer and should perhaps be considered as purely local. These are particularly numerous in Iran, where it does seem that the mainstream of early Islamic architecture did not penetrate very deeply. Unfortunately, the archaeological exploration of Iran is still in its infancy, and many of the mud-brick buildings from the early Islamic period have been destroyed or rebuilt beyond recognition. As a result, it is extremely difficult to determine the historical importance of monuments found at Neyrīz, Moḥammadīyeh (near Nāʾīn), Fahraj (near Yazd), or Hazareh (near Samarkand). For an understanding of the mosque’s development and of the general dynamics of Islamic architecture, however, an awareness of those secondary types, which may have existed outside Iran as well, is essential.

      The function of the mosque, the central gathering place of the Muslim community, became the major and most original completely Muslim architectural effort. The mosque was not a purely religious building, at least not at the beginning, but, because it was restricted to Muslims, it is appropriate to consider it as such. This, however, was not the only type of early Islamic building to be uniquely Muslim. Three other types can be defined architecturally and a fourth one only functionally.

      in Jerusalem, is a unique building. Completed in 691, this masterwork of Islamic architecture is the earliest major Islamic monument. Its octagonal plan, use of a high dome, and building techniques are hardly original, although its decoration is unique. Its purpose, however, is what is most remarkable about the building. Since the middle of the 8th century, the Dome of the Rock has become the focal centre of the most mystical event in the life of the Prophet: his ascension into heaven from the rock around which the building was erected. According to an inscription preserved since the erection of the dome, however, it would seem that the building did not originally commemorate the Prophet’s ascension but rather the Christology of Islam and its relationship to Judaism. It seems preferable, therefore, to interpret the Dome of the Rock as a victory monument of the new faith’s ideological and religious claim on a holy city and on all the religious traditions attached to it.

      s have been preserved. The best one is at Sousse, Tunisia; it consists of a square fortified building with a single fairly elaborate entrance and a central courtyard. It has two stories of private or communal rooms. Except for the prominence taken by an oratory, this building could be classified as a type of Muslim secular architecture. Because no later example of a

      <xref articleid="51520">
       mausoleum
      </xref>
      . Originally, Islam was strongly opposed to any formal commemoration of the dead. But three independent factors slowly modified an attitude that was eventually maintained only in the most strictly orthodox circles. One factor was the growth of the
      <xref articleid="67367">
       Shiʿi
      </xref>
      heterodoxy, which led to an actual cult of the descendants of the Prophet through his son-in-law
      <xref articleid="5712">
       ʿAlī
      </xref>
      . The second factor was that, as Islam strengthened its hold on conquered lands, a wide variety of local cultic practices and especially the worship of certain sacred places began to affect the Muslims, resulting in a whole movement of Islamization of ancient holy places by associating them with deceased Muslim heroes and holy men or with prophets. The third factor is not, strictly speaking, religious, but it played a major part. As more or less independent local dynasties began to grow, they sought to commemorate themselves through mausoleums. Not many mausoleums have remained from those early centuries, but literary evidence is clear on the fact that the Shiʿi sanctuaries of
      <xref articleid="44709">

      and
      <xref articleid="54700">

      , both in Iraq, and
      <xref articleid="62128">

      , Iran, already possessed monumental tombs. At Sāmarrāʾ an octagonal mausoleum had been built for three caliphs. The masterpieces of early funerary architecture occur in Central Asia, such as the royal mausoleum of the
      <xref articleid="65183">
       Samanids
      </xref>
      (known incorrectly as the mausoleum of Esmāʿīl the Samanid) at Bukhara (before 942), which is a superb example of Islamic brickwork. In some instances a quasi-religious character was attached to the mausoleums, such as the one at Tim (976), which already has the high facade typical of so many later monumental tombs. In all instances the Muslims took over or rediscovered the ancient tradition of the centrally planned building as the characteristic commemorative structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fourth kind of Muslim building is the madrasah, an institution for religious training set up independently of mosques. It is known from texts that such privately endowed schools existed in the northeastern Iranian world as early as the 9th century, but no description exists of how they looked or were planned.

      Secular architecture
     </title>
     <p>
      Whereas the functions of the religious buildings of early Islam could not have existed without the new faith, the functions of secular Muslim architecture have a priori no specifically Islamic character. This is all the more so since one can hardly point to a significant new need or habit that would have been brought from Arabia by the conquering Muslims and because so little was destroyed in the conquered areas. It can be assumed, therefore, that all pre-Islamic functions such as living, trading, and manufacturing continued in whatever architectural setting they may have had. Only one exception is certain. With the disappearance of
      <xref articleid="65824">
       Sasanian
      </xref>
      kingship, the pre-Islamic Iranian imperial tradition ceased, and elsewhere conquered minor kings and governors left their palaces and castles. A new imperial power was created, located first in Damascus, then briefly in the northern Syrian town of Al-Ruṣāfah, and eventually in Baghdad and Sāmarrāʾ in Iraq. New governors and, later, almost independent princes took over provincial capitals, which sometimes were old seats of government and at other times were new Muslim centres. In all instances, however, there is no reason to assume that for an architecture of power or of pleasure early Muslims would have felt the need to modify pre-Islamic traditions. In fact, there is much in early Islamic secular architecture that can be used to illustrate secular arts elsewhere—in Byzantium, for example, or even in the West. If any new political or social entity is to succeed in preserving an identity of its own, however, it must give to its secular needs certain directions and emphases that will eventually establish a unique cultural image. This is what happened in the development of Umayyad and early Abbasid secular architecture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three factors contributed to the evolution of a new secular architecture. One was that the accumulation of an immense wealth of ideas, workers, and money in the hands of the Muslim princes settled in Syria and Iraq gave rise to a unique palace architecture. The second factor was the impetus given to urban life and to trade. New cities were founded from Sijilmassa on the edge of the Moroccan Sahara to Nīshāpūr in northeastern Iran, and 9th-century Arab merchants traded as far away as China. Thus, the second topic, to be treated below, will be the urban design and commercial architecture. The third factor is that, for the first time since
      <xref articleid="106078">
       Alexander the Great
      </xref>
      , a world extending from the Mediterranean to India became culturally unified. As a result, decorative motifs, design ideas, structural techniques, and artisans and architects—which until then had belonged to entirely different cultural traditions—were available in the same places. Early Islamic princely architecture has become the best-known and most original aspect of early Islamic secular buildings.

    <h4 id="h61839">
     <title>
      Palaces
     </title>
     <p>
      There are basically three kinds of these princely structures. The first type consists of 10 large rural princely complexes found in Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan dating from about 710 to 750: Al-Ruṣāfah, Qaṣr al-Ḥayr East, Qaṣr al-Ḥayr West, Jabal Says, Khirbat Minyah, Khirbat al-Mafjar, Mshattā, Qaṣr ʿAmrah, Qaṣr al-Kharānah, and Qaṣr al-Ṭūbah. Apparently, those examples of princely architecture belong to a group of more than 60 ruined or only textually identifiable rural complexes erected by Umayyad princes. In the past a romantic theory had developed about their locations, suggesting that the remoteness of their sites expressed an atavistic hankering on the part of the Umayyad Arab rulers for the desert or at least the semiarid steppe that separates the permanently cultivated areas of Syria and Palestine from their original home in the north Arabian wilderness. This theory has been disproved, for every one of those has turned out to have been a major agricultural or trade centre, some of which were developed even before the Muslim conquest. Private palaces were built, notably at Al-Ruṣāfah, Qaṣr al-Ḥayr West, Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qaṣr ʿAmrah, and Mshattā. Those must be considered as early medieval equivalents of the
      <e type="italic">
       villae rusticae
      </e>
      so characteristic in the ancient Roman period. Although each of those had a number of idiosyncrasies that were presumably inspired by the needs and desires of its owner, all those structures tend to share a number of features that can best be illustrated by Khirbat al-Mafjar.
     </p>
     <p>
      That palace, the richest of them all, contained a residential unit consisting of a square building with an elaborate entrance, a porticoed courtyard, and a number of rooms or halls arranged on two floors. Few of those rooms seem to have any identifiable function, although at Khirbat al-Mafjar a private oratory, a large meeting hall, and an anteroom leading to a cool underground pool have been identified. The main throne room was on the second floor above the entrance. Its plan is not known but probably resembled the preserved throne rooms or reception halls at Qaṣr ʿAmrah and Mshattā, which consisted of a three-aisled hall ending in an apse (semicircular or polygonal domed projection) in the manner of a Roman basilica.
     </p>
     <p>
      Next to an official residence, there usually was a small mosque, generally a miniaturized hypostyle in plan. The most original feature of those establishments was the bath. The bathing area itself is comparatively small, but every bath had its own elaborate entrance and contained a large hall that, at least in the instance of Khirbat al-Mafjar, was heavily decorated and of an unusual shape. It would appear that those halls were for pleasure—places for music, dancing, and probably occasional orgies. In some instances, as at Qaṣr ʿAmrah, the same setting may have been used for both pleasure and formal receptions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those palaces are important illustrations of the luxurious taste and way of life of the new Middle Eastern aristocrats, who settled in the countryside and transformed some of it into places of pleasure. This aspect of those establishments is peculiar to the Umayyad dynasty in Syria and Palestine. Outside this area and period only one comparable structure has been found—at Ukhayḍir in Iraq, which dates from the early Abbasid period. A number of princely residences of the Central Asian or North African countryside are still too little known but appear not to have had the same development. The other important lesson to draw from them is that few of their features are original. All of them derive from the architectural vocabulary of pre-Islamic times, and it is in the artistic traditions of the Mediterranean world that most of their sources are found, although the Mshattā throne room does have a number of Sasanian elements. For this reason, those palaces should be considered major examples of pre-Islamic secular architecture, for as interesting as they are, these monuments are not part of the Islamic tradition.
     </p>
     <p>
      A second type of princely architecture—the urban palace—has been preserved only in texts or literary sources, with the exception of the palace at
      <xref articleid="46361">
       Kūfah
      </xref>
      in Iraq. Datable from the very end of the 7th century, this example of princely architecture seems to have functioned both as a residence and as the
      <e type="italic">
       dār al-imārah
      </e>
      , or centre of government. This dual function is reflected in the use of separate building units and in the absence of much architectural decoration, which suggests that it reflected an austere official taste. Although suggestions concerning the plans used are occasionally encountered in literary sources, this information is not sufficient to define those early urban official buildings of the Muslims. Nothing is known, for instance, about the great Umayyad palace in Damascus aside from the fact that it had a green dome.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also poorly documented is a development in urban aristocratic buildings that seems to have begun with the Abbasids during the last decades of the 8th century. This involved the construction of smaller palaces, probably pavilions in the midst of gardens in or around major cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The third type of early Islamic princely architecture is the palace-city. Several of these huge palaces are part of the enormous mass of ruins at Sāmarrāʾ, the temporary Abbasid capital from 838 to 883. Jawsaq al-Khāqānī, for instance, is a walled architectural complex nearly one mile to a side that in reality is an entire city. It contains a formal succession of large gates and courts leading to a cross-shaped throne room, a group of smaller living units, basins and fountains, and even a racetrack. Too little is known about the architectural details of those huge walled complexes to lead to more than very uncertain hypotheses. Their existence, however, suggests that they were settings for the very elaborate ceremonies developed by the Abbasid princes, especially when receiving foreign ambassadors. An account, for instance, in Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī’s (died 1071)
      <e type="italic">
       Ta’rīkh Baghdād
      </e>
      (“History of Baghdad”) of the arrival in Baghdad of a Byzantine envoy in 914 illustrates this point. The meeting with the caliph was preceded by a sort of formal presentation intended to impress the ambassador with the Muslim ruler’s wealth and power. Treasures were laid down; thousands of soldiers and slaves in rich clothes guarded them; lions roared in the gardens; and on gilded artificial trees mechanical devices made silver birds chirp. The ceremony was a fascinating mixture of a traditional attempt to re-create paradise on earth and a rather vulgar exhibition of wealth that required a huge space, as in the Sāmarrāʾ palaces. Another important aspect of those palace-cities is that they became part of a myth. The walled enclosure in which thousands lived a life unknown to others and into which simple mortals did not penetrate without bringing their own shroud was transformed into legend. It became the mysterious City of Brass of
      <e type="italic">
       The Thousand and One Nights
      </e>
      , and it is from its luxurious glory that occasionally a caliph such as
      <xref articleid="39414">
       Hārūn al-Rashīd
      </xref>
      escaped into the “real” world. Even information on the Abbasid palace-city is inadequate; it was clearly a unique early Islamic creation, and its impact can be detected from Byzantium to Hollywood.

      Urban design
     </title>
     <p>
      Islamic secular architecture has left considerable information about cities, for systematic urbanization was one of the most characteristic features of early Muslim civilization. It is much too early to draw any sort of conclusion about the actual physical organization of towns, about their subdivisions and their houses, for only at Al-Fusṭāṭ (Cairo) and Sīrāf in Iran is the evidence archaeologically clear, and much of it has not yet been properly published. A huge task remains to be done of relating immense amounts of textual material with scraps of archaeological information scattered from Central Asia to Spain, such as the outer walls and impressive gateway preserved at
      <xref articleid="62715">
       Al-Raqqah
      </xref>
      in Syria. In general, it can be said that there does not seem to have been any idealized master plan for the internal arrangement of an urban site, in contradistinction to Hellenistic or Roman towns. Even mosques or palaces were often located eccentrically and not in the middle of the town. Extraordinary attention was paid to water distribution and conservation, as demonstrated by the magnificent 9th-century cisterns in Tunisia, the 9th-century Nilometer (a device to measure the Nile’s level) in Cairo, and the elaborate dams, canals, and sluices of Qaṣr al-Ḥayr in Syria. The construction of commercial buildings on a monumental scale occurred. The most spectacular example is the caravansary of Qaṣr al-Ḥayr East, with its magnificent gate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The concern for palaces and cities that characterized early Islamic secular architecture shows itself most remarkably in the construction of Baghdad between 762 and 766–767 by the Abbasid caliph
      <xref articleid="50628">
       al-Manṣūr
      </xref>
      . It was a walled round city whose circular shape served to demonstrate Baghdad’s symbolic identity as the navel of the universe. A thick ring of residential quarters was separated by four axial commercial streets entered through spectacular gates. In the centre of the city there was a large open space with a palace, a mosque, and a few administrative buildings. By its size and number of inhabitants, Baghdad was unquestionably a city; however, its plan so strongly emphasized the presence of the caliph that it was also a palace.

      Building materials and technology
     </title>
     <p>
      The early Islamic period, on the whole, did not innovate much in the realm of building materials and technology but utilized what it had inherited from older traditions. Stone and brick continued to be used throughout the Mediterranean, whereas mud brick usually covered with plaster predominated in Iraq and Iran, with a few notable exceptions such as Sīrāf, where a masonry of roughly cut stones set in mortar was more common. The most important novelty was the rapid development in Iraq of a baked brick architecture in the late 8th and 9th centuries. Iraqi techniques were later used in Syria at Al-Raqqah and Qaṣr al-Ḥayr East and in Egypt. Iranian brickwork appears at Mshattā in Jordan. The mausoleum of the Samanids in Bukhara is the earliest remaining example of the new brick architecture in northeastern Iran. Wood was used consistently but usually has not been very well preserved, except in Palestine and Egypt, where climatic (extreme dryness of Egypt), religious (holiness of Jerusalem sanctuaries), or historic (Egypt was never conquered) factors contributed to the continuous upkeep of wooden objects and architectural elements.

      As supports for roofs and ceilings, early Islamic architecture used walls and single supports. Walls were generally continuous, often buttressed with half towers, and rarely (with exceptions in Central Asia) were they articulated or broken by other architectural features. The most common single support was the base-column-capital combination of Mediterranean architecture. Most columns and
      <xref articleid="20145">

      </xref>
      either were reused from pre-Islamic buildings or were directly imitated from older models. In the 9th century in Iraq a brick
      <xref articleid="59964">
       pier
      </xref>
      was used, a form that spread to Iran and Egypt. Columns and piers were covered with
      <xref articleid="9254">
       arches
      </xref>
      . Most often these were semicircular arches; the pointed, or two-centred, arch was known, but it does not seem that its property of reducing the need for heavy supports had been realized. The most extraordinary technical development of arches occurs in the
      <xref articleid="26272">
       Great Mosque at Córdoba
      </xref>
      , where, in order to increase the height of the building in an area with only short columns, the architects created two rows of superimposed horseshoe arches. Almost immediately they realized that such a succession of superimposed arches constructed of alternating stone and brick could be modified to create a variety of patterns that would alleviate the inherent monotony of a hypostyle building. A certain ambiguity remains, however, as to whether ornamental effect or structural technology was the predominate concern in the creation of those unique arched columns.

      (supports carried across corners to act as structural transitions to a dome). Most squinches, as in the Kairouan domes, are classical Greco-Roman niches, which transform the square room into an octagonal opening for the dome. In Córdoba’s Great Mosque a complex system of intersecting ribs is encountered, whereas at Bukhara the squinch is broken into halves by a transverse half arch. The most extraordinary use of the squinch occurs in the mausoleum at Tim, where the surface of this structural device is broken into a series of smaller three-dimensional units rearranged into a sort of pyramidal pattern. This rearrangement is the earliest extant example of
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      , or stalactite-like decoration that would later be an important element of Islamic architectural ornamentation. The motif is so awkwardly constructed at Tim that it must have derived from some other source, possibly the ornamental device of using curved stucco panels to cover the corners and upper parts of walls found in Iran at Nīshāpūr.

      Architectural decoration

      Early Islamic architecture is most original in its decoration.
      <xref articleid="108356">
       Mosaics
      </xref>
      and wall paintings followed the practices of antiquity and were primarily employed in Syria, Palestine, and Spain. Stone sculpture existed, but stucco sculpture, first limited to Iran, spread rapidly throughout the early Islamic world. Not only were stone or brick walls covered with large panels of stucco sculpture, but this technique was used for sculpture in the round in the Umayyad palaces of Qaṣr al-Ḥayr West and Khirbat al-Mafjar. The latter was a comparatively short-lived technique, although it produced some of the few instances of monumental sculpture anywhere in the early Middle Ages. A variety of techniques borrowed from the industrial arts were used for architectural ornamentation. The mihrab wall of Kairouan’s Great Mosque, for example, was covered with ceramics, whereas fragments of decorative woodwork have been preserved in Jerusalem and Egypt.
     </p>
     <p>
      The themes and motifs of early Islamic decoration can be divided into three major groups. The first kind of ornamentation simply emphasizes the shape or contour of an architectural unit. The themes used were vegetal bands for vertical or horizontal elements, marble imitations for the lower parts of long walls, chevrons or other types of borders on floors and domes, and even whole trees on the
      <xref articleid="68986">
       spandrels
      </xref>
      or soffits (undersides) of arches as in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus or the Dome of the Rock; all these motifs tend to be quite traditional, being taken from the rich decorative vocabularies of pre-Islamic Iran or of the ancient Mediterranean world.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second group consists of decorative motifs for which a concrete iconographic meaning can be given. In the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, as well as possibly the mosques of Córdoba and of Medina, there were probably iconographic programs. It has been shown, for example, that the huge architectural and vegetal decorative motifs at Damascus were meant to symbolize a sort of idealized paradise on earth, whereas the crowns of the Jerusalem sanctuary are thought to have been symbols of empires conquered by Islam. But it is equally certain that this use of visual forms in mosques for ideological and symbolic purposes was not easily accepted, and most later mosques are devoid of iconographically significant themes. The only exceptions fully visible are the Qurʾānic inscriptions in the mosque of Ibn Ṭūlūn at Cairo, which were used both as a reminder of the faith and as an ornamental device to emphasize the structural lines of the building. Thus, the early Islamic mosque eventually became austere in its use of symbolic ornamentation, with the exception of the mihrab, which was considered as a symbol of the unity of all believers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like religious architecture, secular buildings seem to have been less richly decorated at the end of the early Islamic period than at the beginning. The paintings, sculptures, and mosaics of Qaṣr al-Ḥayr West, Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qaṣr ʿAmrah, and Sāmarrāʾ primarily illustrated the life of the prince. There were official iconographic compositions, such as the monarch enthroned, or ones of pleasure and luxury, such as hunting scenes or depictions of the prince surrounded by dancers, musicians, acrobats, and unclad women. Few of these so-called princely themes were iconographic inventions of the Muslims. They usually can be traced back either to the classical world of ancient Greece and Rome or to pre-Islamic Iran and Central Asia.
     </p>
     <p>
      The third type of architectural decoration consists of large panels, most often in stucco, for which no meaning or interpretation is yet known. Those panels might be called ornamental in the sense that their only apparent purpose was to beautify the buildings in which they were installed, and their relationship to the architecture is arbitrary. The Mshattā facade’s decoration of a huge band of triangles is, for instance, quite independent of the building’s architectural parts. Next to Mshattā, the most important series of examples of the third type of ornamentation come from Sāmarrāʾ, although striking examples are also to be found at Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qaṣr al-Ḥayr East and West, Al-Fusṭāṭ, Sīrāf, and Nīshāpūr. Two decorative motifs were predominately used on those panels: a great variety of vegetal motifs and geometric forms. At Sāmarrāʾ those panels eventually became so abstract that individual parts could no longer be distinguished, and the decorative design had to be viewed in terms of the relationships between line and shape, light and shade, horizontal and vertical axes, and so forth. Copied consistently from Morocco to Central Asia, the aesthetic principles of this latter type of a complex overall design influenced the development of the principle of
      <xref articleid="8148">

      </xref>
      ornamentation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Islamic architectural ornamentation does not lend itself easily to chronological stylistic definition. In other words, it does not seem to share consistently a cluster of formal characteristics. The reason is that in the earliest Islamic buildings the decorative motifs were borrowed from an extraordinary variety of stylistic sources: classical themes illusionistically rendered (e.g., the mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus), hieratic Byzantine themes (e.g., the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus and Qaṣr ʿAmrah), Sasanian motifs, Central Asian motifs (especially the sculpture from Umayyad palaces), and the many regional styles of ornamentation that had developed in all parts of the pre-Islamic world. It is the wealth of themes and motifs, therefore, that constitutes the Umayyad style of architectural decoration. The Abbasids, on the other hand, began to be more selective in their choice of ornamentation.

     Very little is known about early Islamic gold and silver objects, although their existence is mentioned in many texts as well as suggested by the wealth of the Muslim princes. Except for a large number of silver plates and ewers belonging to the Sasanian tradition, nothing has remained. Those silver objects were probably made for Umayyad and Abbasid princes, although there is much controversy among scholars regarding their authenticity and date of manufacture.
    </p>
    <p>
     For entirely different reasons it is impossible to present any significant generalities about the art of textiles in the early Islamic period. Problems of authenticity are few. Dating from the 10th century are a large number of Buyid silks, a group of funerary textiles with plant and animal motifs as well as poetic texts. Very little order has yet been made of an enormous mass of often well-dated textile fragments, and, therefore, except for the Buyid silks, it is still impossible to identify any one of the textile types mentioned in early medieval literary sources. Furthermore, because it can be assumed that pre-Islamic textile factories were taken over by the Muslims and because it is otherwise known that textiles were easily transported from one area of the Muslim world to the other or even beyond it, it is still very difficult to define Islamic styles as opposed to Byzantine or to Coptic ones. The obvious exception lies in those fragments that are provided with inscriptions, and the main point to make is, therefore, that one of the characteristic features of early Islamic textiles is their use of writing for identifying and decorative purposes. But, while true, this point in no way makes it possible to deny an Islamic origin to fragments that are not provided with inscriptions, and one must thus await further investigations of detail before being able to define early Islamic textiles.

     The most important medium of early Islamic decorative arts is pottery. Initially Muslims continued to sponsor whatever varieties of ceramics had existed before their arrival. Probably in the last quarter of the 8th century, new and more elaborate types of glazed pottery were produced. This new development did not replace the older and simpler types of pottery but added a new dimension to the art of Islamic ceramics. Because of the still incompletely published studies on the unfinished excavations carried out at Nīshāpūr, Sīrāf, Qaṣr al-Ḥayr East, and Al-Fusṭāṭ, the scholarship on those ceramics is likely to be very much modified. Therefore, this section will treat only the most general characteristics of Islamic ceramics, avoiding in particular the complex archaeological problems posed by the growth and spread of individual techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
     The area of initial technical innovation seems to have been Iraq. Trade with Central Asia brought Chinese ceramics to Mesopotamia, and Islamic ceramicists sought to imitate them. It is probably in Iraq, therefore, that the technique of lustre glazing was first developed in the Muslim world. This gave the surface of a clay object a metallic, shiny appearance. Egypt also played a leading part in the creation of the new ceramics. Because the earliest datable lustre object (a glass goblet with the name of the governor who ruled in 773, now in the Cairo Museum of Islamic Ceramics) was Egyptian, some scholars feel that it was in Egypt and not Iraq that lustre was first used. Early pottery was also produced in northeastern Iran, where excavations at Afrāsiyāb (
     <xref articleid="65195">
      Samarkand
     </xref>
     ) and Nīshāpūr have brought to light a new art of painted underglaze pottery. Its novelty was not so much in the technique of painting designs on the slip and covering them with a transparent glaze as in the variety of subjects employed.
    </p>
    <p>
     While new ceramic techniques may have been sought to imitate other mediums (mostly metal) or other styles of pottery (mostly Chinese), the decorative devices rapidly became purely and unmistakably Islamic in style. A wide variety of motifs were combined: vegetal arabesques or single flowers and trees; inscriptions, usually legible and consisting of proverbs or of good wishes; animals that were usually birds drawn from the vast folkloric past of the Middle East; occasionally human figures drawn in a strikingly abstract fashion; geometric designs; all-over abstract patterns; single motifs on empty fields; and simple splashes of colour, with or without underglaze
     <xref articleid="67031">
      sgraffito
     </xref>
     designs (i.e., designs incised or sketched on the body or the slip of the object). All these motifs were used on both the high-quality ceramics of Nīshāpūr and Samarkand as well as on Islamic folk pottery.

     Although ceramics has appeared to be the most characteristic medium of expression in the decorative arts during the early Islamic period, it has only been because of the greater number of preserved objects. Glass was as important, but examples have been less well preserved. A tradition of ivory carving developed in Spain, and the objects dating from the last third of the 10th century onward attest to the high quality of this uniquely Iberian art. Many of those carved ivories certainly were made for princes; therefore, it is not surprising that their decorative themes were drawn from the whole vocabulary of princely art known through Umayyad painting and sculpture of the early 8th century. Those ivory carvings are also important in that they exemplify the fact that an art of sculpture in the round never totally disappeared in the Muslim world—at least in small objects.

     Assessment
    </title>
    <p>
     There are three general points that seem to characterize the art of the early Islamic period. It can first be said that it was an art that sought self-consciously, like the culture sponsoring it, to create artistic forms that would be identifiable as being different from those produced in preceding or contemporary non-Islamic artistic traditions. At times, as in the use of the Greco-Roman technique of
     <xref articleid="108356">
      mosaics
     </xref>
     or in the adoption of Persian and Roman architectural building technology, early Islamic art simply took over whatever traditions were available. At other times, as in the development of the mosque as a building type, it recomposed into new shapes the forms that had existed before. On the other hand, in ceramics or the use of
     <xref articleid="110482">
      calligraphic
     </xref>
     ornamentation, the early Islamic artist invented new techniques and a new decorative vocabulary. Whatever the nature of the phenomenon, it was almost always an attempt to identify itself visually as unique and different. Because there was initially no concept about what should constitute an Islamic tradition in the visual arts, the early art of the Muslims often looks like only a continuation of earlier artistic styles, forms, subjects, and techniques. Many mosaics, silver plates, or textiles, therefore, were not considered to be Islamic until recently. In order to be understood, then, as examples of the art of a new culture, those early buildings and objects have to be seen in the complete context in which they were created. When so seen, they appear as conscious choices by the new Islamic culture from its immense artistic inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
     A second point of definition concerns the question of whether there is an early Islamic style or perhaps even several styles in some sort of succession. The fascinating fact is that there is a clear succession only in those artistic features that are Islamic inventions—nonfigurative ornament and ceramics. For it is only in development of those features that one can assume to find the conscious search for form that can create a period style. Elsewhere, especially in palace art, the Muslim world sought to relate itself to an earlier and more universal tradition of princely art; its monuments, therefore, are less Islamic than typological. In the new art of the Muslim bourgeoisie, however, uniquely Islamic artistic phenomena began to evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the geographical peculiarities of early Islamic art must be reiterated. Its centres were Syria, Iraq, Egypt, northwestern Iran, and Spain. Of these, Iraq was probably the most originally creative, and it is from Iraq that a peculiarly Islamic visual koine (a commonly accepted and understood system of forms) was derived and spread throughout the Islamic world. This development, of course, is logical, because the capital of the early empire and some of the first purely Muslim cities were in Iraq. In western Iran, in Afghanistan, in northern Mesopotamia, and in Morocco, the more atypical and local artistic traditions were more or less affected by the centralized imperial system of Iraq. This tension between a general pan-Islamic vocabulary and a variable number of local vocabularies was to remain a constant throughout the history of Islamic art and is certainly one of the reasons for the difficulty, if not impossibility, one faces in trying to define an Islamic style.

    Middle period
   </title>
   <p>
    The middle period in the development of Islamic art extends roughly from the year 1000 to 1500, when a strong central power with occasional regional political independence was replaced by a bewildering mosaic of overlapping dynasties. Ethnically, this was the time of major Turkish and Mongol invasions that brought into the Muslim world new peoples and institutions. At the same time, Imazighen (

     Iranians
    </xref>
    , who had been within the empire from the beginning of Islam, began to play far more effective historical and cultural roles, short-lived for the Kurds but uniquely important for the Iranians. Besides political and ethnic confusion, there was also religious and cultural confusion during the middle period. The 10th century, for example, witnessed the transformation of the
    <xref articleid="67367">
     Shiʿi
    </xref>
    heterodoxy into a major political and possibly cultural phenomenon, while the extraordinary development taken by the personal and social mysticism known as
    <xref articleid="105856">
     Sufism
    </xref>
    modified enormously the nature of Muslim piety. Culturally, the most significant development was perhaps that of
    <xref articleid="59342">

    </xref>
    as a highly original new verbal expression existing alongside the older
    <xref articleid="8159">
     Arabic literary tradition
    </xref>
    . Finally, the middle period was an era of geopolitical expansion in all areas except Spain, which was completely lost to the Muslims in 1492 with the conquest of the kingdom of
    <xref articleid="37648">
     Granada
    </xref>

    <xref articleid="27904">
     Crimean Peninsula
    </xref>
    , much of Central Asia and northern India, and parts of eastern Africa all became new Islamic provinces. In some cases this expansion was the result of conquests, but in others it had been achieved through missionary work.
   </p>
   <p>
    The immense variety of impulses that affected the Muslim world during those five centuries was one of the causes of the bewildering artistic explosion that also characterizes the middle period. Although much work has been done on individual monuments, scholarship is still in its infancy. It is particularly difficult, therefore, to decide on the appropriate means of organizing this information: by geographical or cultural areas (e.g., Iran, Egypt, Morocco), by individual dynasties (e.g., Seljuqs, Timurids), by periods (e.g., 13th century before the Mongol invasions), or even by social categories (e.g., the art of princes, the art of cities). Thus, the five following divisions of

In the latter part of the 11th century, however, the Fatimid empire began to disintegrate internally and externally; the final demise occurred in 1171. But it is not known which of the obvious components of the Fatimid world was more significant in influencing the development of the visual arts: its heterodoxy, its Egyptian location, its missionary relationship with almost all provinces of Islam, or the fact that during its heyday in the 11th century it was the only wealthy Islamic centre and could thus easily gather artisans and art objects from all over the world.

       Cairo
      </xref>
      —Al-Azhar (started in 970) and Al-Ḥākim (c. 1002–03)—were designed in the traditional hypostyle plan with axial cupolas. It is only in such architectural details as the elaborately composed facade of Al-Ḥākim, with its corner towers and vaulted portal, that innovations appear, for most earlier mosques did not have large formal gates, nor was much attention previously given to the composition of the exterior facade. Fatimid architectural traditionalism was certainly a conscious attempt to perpetuate the existing aesthetic system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although much less is known about it, the Great Palace of the Fatimids belonged to the tradition of the enormous palace-cities typical of the Abbasids. Mediterranean rather than Iranian influences, however, played a greater part in the determination of its uses and functions. The whole city of Cairo (Arabic: Al-Qāhirah, “The Victorious”), on the other hand, has many symbolic and visual aspects that suggest a willful relationship to
      <xref articleid="109394">
       Baghdad
      </xref>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The originality of Fatimid architecture does not lie in works sponsored by the caliphs themselves, even though Cairo’s well-preserved gates and walls of the second half of the 11th century are among the best examples of early medieval military architecture. It is rather the patronage of lower officials and of the bourgeoisie, if not even of the humbler classes, that was responsible for the most interesting Fatimid buildings. The mosques of Al-Aqmar (1125) and of Al-Ṣāliḥ (c. 1160) are among the first examples of monumental small mosques constructed to serve local needs. Even though their internal arrangement is quite traditional, their plans were adapted to the space available in the urban centre. These mosques were elaborately decorated on the exterior, exhibiting a conspicuousness absent from large hypostyle mosques.
     </p>
     <p>
      A second innovation in Fatimid architecture was the tremendous development of
      <xref articleid="51520">
       mausoleums
      </xref>
      . This may be explained partially by Shiʿism’s emphasis on the succession of holy men, but the development of these buildings in terms of both quality and quantity indicates that other influential social and religious issues were also involved. Most of the mausoleums were simple square buildings surmounted by a dome. Many of these have survived in Cairo and
      <xref articleid="10016">
       Aswān
      </xref>
      . Only a few, such as the
      <e type="italic">
       mashhad
      </e>
      at Aswān, are somewhat more elaborate, with side rooms. The most original of these commemorative buildings is the Juyūshī Mosque (1085) overlooking the city of Cairo. Properly speaking, it is not a mausoleum but a monument celebrating the reestablishment of Fatimid order after a series of popular revolts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fatimids introduced, or developed, only two major constructional techniques: the systematization of the four-centred keel arch and the squinch. The latter innovation is of greater consequence because the squinch became the most common means of passing from a square to a dome, although
      <xref articleid="59051">
       pendentives
      </xref>
      were known as well. A peculiarly Egyptian development was the
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      squinch, which consisted of four units: a niche bracketed by two niche segments, superimposed with an additional niche. The complex profile of the
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      became an architectural element in itself used for windows, while the device of using niches and niche segments remained typical of Egyptian decorative design for centuries. It still is impossible to say whether the
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      was invented in Egypt or inspired by other architectural traditions (most likely Iranian). Fatimid domes were smooth or ribbed and developed a characteristic “keel” profile.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the use of materials (brick, stone, wood) and structural concepts, Fatimid architecture continued earlier traditions. Occasionally, local styles were incorporated, among them features of Tunisian architecture in the 10th century or of upper Mesopotamian in the late 11th century.

      murals. Many fragments of Fatimid wall paintings have survived in Egypt. Most of them, however, are too small to allow for making any iconographic or stylistic conclusions, with the exception of the mid-12th-century ceiling of the Palatine Chapel at Palermo. Built by the Norman kings of Sicily, the palace chapel was almost certainly decorated by Fatimid artists, or at least the artists adhered to Fatimid models. The hundreds of facets in the
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      ceiling were painted, notably with many purely ornamental vegetal and zoomorphic designs but also with scenes of daily life and many subjects that have not yet been explained. Stylistically influenced by Iraqi Abbasid art, these paintings are innovative in their more spatially aware representation of personages and of animals. Very similar tendencies appear also in the stucco and wood sculptures of Fatimid decoration. The stunning abstraction of the architectural decoration at Sāmarrāʾ tends to give way to more naturalistically conceived vegetal and animal designs; occasionally, whole narrative scenes appear carved on wood. Another decorative trend is especially used on 12th-century mihrabs: explicitly complicated geometric patterns, usually based on stars, which in turn generate octagons, hexagons, triangles, and rectangles. Geometry becomes a sort of network containing small vegetal units, often as inlaid pieces. Long inscriptions written in very elaborate calligraphies also became a typical form of architectural decoration on most of the major Fatimid buildings.

      A clear separation must be made between the decorative arts sought by Fatimid princes and the arts produced within their empire. Little has been preserved of the former, notably a small number of superb ewers in rock crystal. A text has survived, however, that describes the imperial treasures looted in the middle of the 11th century by dissatisfied mercenary troops. It lists gold, silver, enamel, and porcelain objects that have all been lost, as well as textiles (perhaps the cape of the Norman king
      <xref articleid="83727">
       Roger II

      is an example of the kind of textiles found in this treasure). The inventory also records that the Fatimids had in their possession many works of Byzantine, Chinese, and even Greco-Roman provenance. Altogether, then, it seems that the imperial art of the Fatimids was part of a sort of international royal taste that downplayed cultural or political differences.

      Ceramics, on the other hand, were primarily produced by local urban schools and were not an imperial art. The most-celebrated type of Fatimid wares were lustre-painted ceramics from Egypt itself. A large number of artisans’ names have been preserved, thereby indicating the growing prestige of these craftsmen and the aesthetic importance of their pottery. Most of the surviving lustre ceramics are plates on which the decoration of the main surface has been emphasized. The decorative themes used were quite varied and included all the traditional Islamic ones—e.g., calligraphy, vegetal and animal motifs, arabesques. The most-distinguishing feature of these Fatimid ceramics, however, is the representation of the human figure. Some of these ceramics have been decorated with simplified copies of illustrations of the princely themes, but others have depictions of scenes of Egyptian daily life. The style in which these themes have been represented is simultaneously the hieratic, ornamental manner traditional to Islamic painting combined with what can almost be called spatial illusionism. Wheel-cut rock crystal, glass, and bronze objects, especially animal-shaped aquamaniles (a type of water vessel) and ewers, are also attributed to the Fatimids.

     <p>
      Manifestations of nonprincely Fatimid art also included the art of book illustration. The few remaining fragments illustrate that probably after the middle of the 11th century there developed an art of representation other than the style used to illustrate princely themes. This was a more illusionistic style that still accompanied the traditional ornamental one in the same manner as in the paintings on ceramics.
     </p>
     <p>
      In summary it would appear that Fatimid art was a curiously transitional one. Although much influenced by earlier Islamic and non-Islamic Mediterranean styles, the Fatimids devised new structural systems and developed a new manner of painting representational subjects, which became characteristic of all Muslim art during the 12th century. Neither documentary nor theoretical research in Islamic art, however, has developed sufficiently to clearly establish whether the Fatimids were indeed innovators or whether their art was a local phenomenon that is only accidentally relatable to what followed.

The dominant political force among those Turks was the dynasty of the Seljuqs, but it was not the only one; nor can it be demonstrated, as far as the arts are concerned, that it was the major source of patronage in the period to be discussed anywhere but in Anatolia in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Seljuq empire, therefore, consisted of a succession of dynasties, and all but one (the

The art of the Seljuq period, however, is difficult to discuss coherently, both because of the wealth of examples and because of the lack of synchronization between various technical and regional developments. This complex world fell apart under the impact of the Mongol invasions that, from 1220 until 1260, swept through the Muslim lands of the Middle East.

     <p>
      The functions of monumental architecture in the Seljuq period were considerably modified. Large congregational mosques were still built. The earliest Seljuq examples occur in the two major new provinces of Islam—Anatolia and northwestern India—as well as in the established Muslim region of western Iran. In some areas, such as the Eṣfahān region, congregational mosques were rebuilt, while in other parts of the Islamic world, such as Syria or Egypt, where there was no need for new large mosques, older ones were repaired and small ones were built. The latter were partly restricted to certain quarters or groups or were commissioned by various guilds, particularly in Damascus.

      <xref articleid="49917">
       madrasah
      </xref>
      (school), however, was a new building type. There is much controversy as to why and how it really developed. Although early examples have been discovered in Iran, such as the 11th-century madrasah of Khargird, and at Samarkand (now in Uzbekistan), it is from Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt that most of the information about the madrasah has been derived. In the latter regions it was usually a privately endowed establishment reserved for one or two of the schools of jurisprudence of orthodox Islam. It had to have rooms for teaching and living quarters for the students and professors. Often the tomb of the founder was attached to the madrasah. Later madrasahs were built for two or three schools of jurisprudence, and the Mustanṣiriyyah in Baghdad was erected in 1233 to be a sort of ecumenical madrasah for the whole of Sunni Islam.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Seljuq period there occurred a revival of the hostel-like

      <e type="italic">

      s (monastic complexes), monasteries, and various establishments of learning other than formal madrasahs were also built.
     </p>
     <p>
      An impressive development of secular architecture occurred under the Seljuqs. The most characteristic building of the time was the citadel, or urban fortress, through which the new princes controlled the usually alien city they held in fief. The largest citadels, like those of Cairo and Aleppo, were whole cities with palaces, mosques, sanctuaries, and baths. Others, like the citadel of Damascus, were simpler constructions. Occasionally, as in the Euphrates valley, single castles were built, possibly in imitation of those constructed by the Christian Crusaders. Walls surrounded most cities, and all of them were built or rebuilt during the Seljuq period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Little is known about Seljuq palaces or private residences in general. A few fragments in Konya or in Mosul are insufficient to give a coherent idea about urban palaces, and it is only in Anatolia and in Central Asia that an adequate idea of other types can be obtained. Anatolian palaces are on the whole rather small villa-like establishments, but, in Afghanistan and Central Asia, excavations at Tirmidh, Lashkarī Bāzār, and Ghaznī have brought to light a whole group of large royal palaces erected in the 11th and early 12th centuries.

      Commercial architecture became very important. Individual princes and cities probably were trying to attract business by erecting elaborate caravansaries on the main trade routes, such as Ribāṭ-i Malik, built between Samarkand and Bukhara in Uzbekistan. The most spectacular caravansaries were built in the 13th century in Anatolia. Equally impressive, however, although less numerous, are the caravansaries erected in eastern Iran and northern Iraq. Bridges also were rebuilt and decorated like the one at Cizre in Turkey.
     </p>
     <p>
      The forms of architecture developed by the Seljuqs were remarkably numerous and varied considerably from region to region. Because the Iranian innovations dating from the 11th century and first half of the 12th century are the earliest and, therefore, probably influenced all other areas of the Seljuq empire, they will be discussed first.

      Even though it is not entirely typical, the justly celebrated Great Mosque of Eṣfahān was one of the most influential of all early Seljuq religious structures. Probably completed about 1130 after a long and complicated history of rebuildings, it consisted of a large courtyard on which opened four large vaulted halls known as

      was followed by a huge cupola. The area between
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      s was subdivided into a large number of square bays covered by domes. The Eṣfahān mosque also had a unique feature: on the north side a single domed hall positioned on the main axis of the building was in all probability a formal hall for princes to change their clothes before entering into the sanctuary of the mosque.

      The two features of the Great Mosque at Eṣfahān that became characteristic of Seljuq mosques were the
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      and the dome. The
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      was an architectural element known already in Sasanian architecture that had been used in residential buildings from Egypt to Central Asia before the 11th century. In fact, the use of the
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      was not restricted to just mosques; it also appears in palaces (Lashkarī Bāzār), caravansaries (Rebāṭ-e Sharaf), and madrasahs. The
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      was, in other words, a unit of architectural composition that had no specific use and, therefore, no meaning. In the mosques of the 12th century, four
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      s were used, at least in the clearly definable architectural school of western Iran (e.g., Ardestān, Zavāreh). This kind of composition had two principal effects. One was that the
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      s centralized the visual effect of the mosque by making the courtyard the centre of the building. The other effect of this composition was that it broke up into four areas what had for centuries been a characteristic of the mosque: its single, unified space. The reasons for those developments are still speculative.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether large or small, cupolas or domes were used in mosques, caravansaries, and palaces. They were the main architectural features of almost all mausoleums, where they were set over circular or polygonal rooms.

      (such as the one at Jām). Shorter and squatter towers were mausoleums. Those were particularly typical of northern Iran. The other characteristic architectural type exists only in Eṣfahān in a much-damaged state. It is the

     <p>
      Domes and
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      s indicate that the central concern of Iranian construction during the Seljuq period was vaulting in baked brick, which became the main vehicle for any monumental construction (mud brick was used for secondary parts of a building, frequently for certain secular structures). A large and forcefully composed octagonal base developed the
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      squinch from a purely ornamental feature into one wherein both structural and decorative functions combined. In some later buildings, such as the mausoleum of
      <xref articleid="65522">
       Sanjar
      </xref>
      at Merv, a system of ribs was used to vault an octagonal zone. Seljuq architects sought to make their domes visible from afar and for that reason invented the double dome. Its outer shell was raised on a high drum, while the interior kept the traditional sequence: square base, zone of transition, and dome. Using this structural device, therefore, exterior height was achieved without making the exterior dome too heavy and without complicating the task of decorating the interior, always a problem in countries like Iran with limited supplies of wood for scaffolding. Domes along the
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      s were another factor that contributed to the growing separation between the exterior and the interior view of a building. The construction of tall circular or polygonal minarets and high facades also indicate an emphasis on visibility from a distance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Architectural decoration was intimately tied to structure. Two mediums predominated. One was stucco, which continued to be used to cover large wall surfaces. The other was brick. Originating in the 10th-century architecture of northeastern Iran, brick came to be employed as a medium of construction as well as a medium of decoration. The complex decorative designs worked out in brick often had a rigidly geometric effect. Especially cut shapes of terra-cotta and brick, frequently produced in unusual sizes, served to soften those geometric patterns by modifying their tactile impact and by introducing additional curved or beveled lines to the straight lines of geometry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paintings were used for architectural decoration, especially in palaces. From the second half of the 12th century, coloured tiles began to be utilized to emphasize the contour of a decorative area in a structural unit; tiles were not used to cover whole walls, however. There are also examples of architectural sculpture of animals and people.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the decorative designs tended to be subordinated to geometry, and even calligraphic or vegetal patterns were affected by a seemingly mathematically controlled aesthetic. It has been suggested that those complex geometric designs were a result of an almost mystical passion for number theories that were popularized in 11th-century Iran by such persons as the scholar and scientist
      <xref articleid="15394">
       al-Bīrūnī
      </xref>
      or the poet-mathematician
      <xref articleid="57079">
       Omar Khayyam
      </xref>
      . But even if the impulses for geometric design were originally created at the highest intellectual level, the designs themselves rapidly became automatic patterns. Their quality was generally high, but a tendency toward facility can be observed in such buildings as Rebāṭ-e Sharaf.

      Architecture in Iraq, Syria, and Anatolia
     </title>
     <p>
      In Iraq, northern Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt (after 1171), the architectural monuments do not, on the whole, appear as overwhelmingly impressive as those of Iran, largely because the taste of Umayyad and Abbasid times continued to dominate mosque architecture. It is in the construction of new building types, particularly the madrasah, that the most originality is apparent. The Syrian madrasahs in Damascus, like Al-ʿĀdiliyyah, Al-Ẓāhiriyyah, or the works of
      <xref articleid="56520">
       Nureddin
      </xref>
      , tended also to follow a comparatively standardized plan: an elaborate facade led into a domed hallway and then into a court with at least one
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      . Most of those madrasahs were small and were fitted into a preexisting urban pattern. The use of
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      s and the construction of the many minarets found in Mosul or on the Euphrates certainly attest to the influence of Iranian Seljuq design.
     </p>
     <p>
      The main achievement of Ayyūbid, Zangid, or Seljuq architecture in the Fertile Crescent was the translating into stone of new structural systems first developed in brick. The most impressive instance of this lies in the technically complex
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      domes and half domes or in the
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      pendentives of Syrian buildings. Elaborate mihrabs were also made of multicoloured stones that were carefully cut to create impressive patterns. The architecture of the Fertile Crescent, therefore, was still dominated by the sheer force of stone as a material for both construction and decoration, and, therefore, the architecture was more Mediterranean in effect than were the buildings of Iran.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Mediterranean tendency was also evident in the 13th-century architecture of Seljuq Anatolia. This new province of Islam was rapidly populated with new immigrants and consequently gathered themes and motifs from throughout the Muslim world, as well as from the several native Anatolian traditions of Byzantine, Armenian, and Georgian architecture. The resulting assimilation of styles produced an overwhelmingly original architecture, for each building in
      <xref articleid="46028">

      and on the roads between them is a unique monument.
     </p>
     <p>
      Functionally, the buildings in Anatolia do not differ from those in other parts of the Muslim world. All the structural forms found in Syria and Iran can be found in Anatolia as well, although they have often been adapted to local materials. Three uniquely Anatolian architectural features, however, can be distinguished. One was limited to Konya at this time but would have an important widespread development later on. As it appears in the Ince or Karatay
      <e type="italic">
       medrese
      </e>
      s (madrasahs), it consists of the transformation of the central courtyard into a domed space while maintaining the
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      . Thus, the centralized aspect of the
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      plan becomes architecturally explicit. The second feature is the creation of a facade that usually consisted of a high central portal—often framed by two minarets—with an elaborately sculpted decorative composition that extended to two corner towers. The third distinguishing feature of Anatolian Seljuq architecture is the complexity of the types of funerary monuments that were constructed.
     </p>
     <p>
      From the point of view of construction, most of Anatolian architecture is of stone. In
      <xref articleid="46028">
       Konya
      </xref>
      and a number of eastern Anatolian instances, brick was used. Barrel vaults, groin vaults,
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      vaults, squinch domes, pendentive domes, and the new pendentive known as Turkish triangle (a transformation of the curved space of the traditional pendentive into a fanlike set of long and narrow triangles built at an angle from each other) were all used by Anatolian builders, thereby initiating the great development of vault construction in Ottoman architecture.

      Architectural decoration consisted primarily in the stone sculpture found on the facades of religious and secular buildings. Although influenced by Iran and Syria in many details, most Anatolian themes were original, although some exhibit Armenian and possibly Western influences. The exuberance of Anatolian architectural decoration can perhaps be best demonstrated in the facades of Sivas’s Gök Medrese and of Konya’s Ince Minare. In addition to the traditional geometric, epigraphic, and vegetal motifs, a decorative sculpture in the round or in high relief was created that included many representations of human figures and especially animals. Whether this sculpture is essentially a reflection of the decorative wealth of pre-Islamic monuments in Anatolia or whether it is a vestige of a pagan Turkish art that originated in Central Asia is still an unsolved historical problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are few examples of wall painting from Anatolia. Especially in Konya, however, a major art of painted-tile decoration did evolve, possibly developed by Iranian artists who fled from the Mongol onslaught.

      In summing up the architectural development of the Seljuq period, three points seem to be particularly significant. One is the expansion of building typology and the erection of new monumental architectural forms, thus illustrating an expansion of patronage and a growing complexity of taste. The second point is that, regardless of the quality and interest of monuments in the
      <xref articleid="34123">
       Fertile Crescent
      </xref>
      , Egypt, and Anatolia, the most inventive and exciting architecture in the 11th and 12th centuries was that of Iran. But, far more than in the preceding period, regional needs and regional characteristics seem to predominate over synchronic and pan-Islamic ones. Finally, there was a striking growth of architectural decoration both in sophistication of design and in variation of technique.

      Although probably not as varied as architecture, the other arts of the Seljuq period also underwent tremendous changes. They demonstrate an extraordinary artistic energy, a widening of the social patronage of the arts, and a hitherto unknown variety of topics and modes of expression. It was as though the Seljuq period was gathering a sort of aesthetic momentum, but that effort seems to have been curtailed by the Mongol invasion. Chronologically, almost all surviving documentation and examples of those arts date from the latter part of the period, after 1150. It is unclear whether this apparent date is merely an accidental result of what has been preserved and is known through later scholarship or whether it corresponds to some precise event or series of events.

      Glass and textiles continued to be major mediums during the Seljuq period. Ceramics underwent many changes, especially in Iran, where lustre painting became widespread and where new techniques were developed for colouring pottery. Furthermore, the growth of tile decoration created a new dimension for the art of ceramics.

In this technique the surfaces of utilitarian metallic objects (candlesticks, ewers, basins, kettles, and so forth) were engraved, and then silver was inlaid in the cut-out areas to make the decorative design more clearly visible.

      All the technical novelties of the Seljuqs seem to have had one main purpose: to animate objects and books and to provide them with clearly visible and identifiable images. Even the austere art of
      <xref articleid="110482" refid="h53194">
       calligraphy
      </xref>
      became occasionally animated with letters ending in human figures. The main centres for producing these arts were located in Iran and the Fertile Crescent. For reasons yet unknown, Egypt and Anatolia were far less involved. One reason may be that those two Seljuq provinces did not witness the same rise of an urban middle class as did Iran, Iraq, and Syria. It would seem from a large number of art objects whose patrons are known that the main market for these works of art was the mercantile bourgeoisie of the big cities and not, as has often been believed, the princes. Seljuq decorative arts and book illustration, therefore, reflect an urban taste.

      The themes and motifs used were particularly numerous. In books they tend to be illustrations of the text, even if a manuscript such as the so-called Schefer
      <e type="italic">
       Maqāmāt
      </e>
      (1237; named for the French Orientalist and bibliophile Charles-Henri-Auguste Schefer [1820–98], who once owned it) sought to combine a strict narrative with a fairly naturalistic panorama of contemporary life. Narrative scenes taken from books or reflecting folk stories are also common on Persian ceramics. In all mediums, however, the predominant vocabulary of images is the one provided by the older art of princes, but its meaning is no longer that of illustrating the actual life of princes but rather that of symbolizing a good and happy life. The motifs, therefore, do not have to be taken literally. Next to princely and narrative themes there are depictions of scenes of daily life, astronomical motifs, and a myriad of topics that can be described but not understood.

      While it is possible within certain limits to generalize about the subject matter of Seljuq art, regional stylistic definitions tend to be more valid. Thus, the bronzes produced in northeastern Iran in the 12th century are characterized by simple decorative compositions rather than by the very elaborate ones created by the so-called
      <xref articleid="53937">
       school of Mosul
      </xref>
      in Iraq during the 13th century. In general, the art of metalwork exhibits a consistently growing intricacy in composition and in details to the point that individual subjects are at times lost in overlapping planes of arabesques. Ceramic pieces of Iran have usually been classified according to a more or less fictitious provenance.

      is less sophisticated in design and execution but more vividly coloured. Sāveh and Gurgān are still other Iranian varieties of pottery. With the exception of Kāshān ware, where dynasties of ceramicists are known, all these types of Iranian pottery were contemporary with each other. In Syria,

      The main identifiable group of miniature painters is the so-called
      <xref articleid="11744">
       Baghdad school
      </xref>
      of the first half of the 13th century. The group should be called the Arab school because the subject matter and style employed could have been identified with any one of the major artistic centres of Egypt and the Fertile Crescent, and very little evidence currently exists to limit this school to one city. The miniatures painted by these artists are characterized by the colourful and often humorous way in which the urbanized Arab is depicted. The compositions, often lacking in any strong aesthetic intent, are documentary caricatures in which the artist has recorded the telling and recognizable gesture or a known and common setting or activity. In many images or compositional devices, one can recognize the impact of the richer Christian Mediterranean tradition of manuscript illumination. A greater attention to aesthetic considerations is apparent in the illustrated manuscript of the Persian epic

First there is the long Court of the Myrtles, leading to the huge Hall of the Ambassadors, located in one of the exterior towers. This was the part of the Alhambra built by Yūsuf I. Then there is the Court of the Lions, with its celebrated lion fountain in the centre. Numerous rooms open off this court, including the elaborately decorated Hall of the Two Sisters and the Hall of the Abencerrajes. The third part, slightly earlier than the first two, is the Generalife; it is a summer residence built higher up the hill and surrounded by gardens with fountains, pavilions, and portico walks.

     The Alhambra is especially important because it is one of the few palaces to have survived from medieval Islamic times. It illustrates superbly a number of architectural concerns occasionally documented in literary references: the contrast between an unassuming exterior and a richly decorated interior to achieve an effect of secluded or private brilliance; the constant presence of water, either as a single, static basin or as a dynamic fountain; the inclusion of oratories and baths; and the lack of an overall plan (the units are simply attached to each other).
    </p>
    <p>
     The architectural decoration of the Alhambra was mostly of stucco. Some of it is flat, but the extraordinarily complex cupolas of
     <e type="italic">
      muqarnas
     </e>
     , as in the Hall of the Two Sisters, appear as huge multifaceted diadems. The decoration of the Alhambra becomes a sort of paradox as well as a tour de force. Weighty, elaborately decorated ceilings, for example, are supported by frail columns or by walls pierced with many windows (light permeates almost every part of the large, domed halls). Much of the design and decoration of the Alhambra is symbolically oriented. The poems that adorn the Alhambra as calligraphic ornamentation celebrate its cupolas as domes of heaven rotating around the prince sitting under them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Islamic art as such ceased to be produced in Spain after 1492, when Granada, the last Moorish kingdom in Spain, fell to the Christians, but the Islamic tradition continued in North Africa, which remained Muslim. In Morocco the so-called Sharīfian dynasties from the 16th century onward ornamentally developed the artistic forms created in the 14th century.

     Most of the best-known monuments of western Islamic art are buildings, although a very original calligraphy was developed. The other arts cannot be compared in wealth and importance either to what occurred elsewhere in Islam at the same time or to earlier objects created in Spain. There are some important examples of metalwork, wood inlaid with
     <xref articleid="43080">
      ivory
     </xref>
     , and a lustre-glaze pottery known as
     <xref articleid="40584">
      Hispano-Moresque ware
     </xref>
     . The fact that the latter was made in Valencia or Málaga after the termination of Muslim rule demonstrates that Islamic traditions in the decorative arts continued to be adhered to, if only partially. The term
     <xref articleid="54131">
      Mudéjar
     </xref>
     , therefore, is used to refer to all the things made in a Muslim style but under Christian rule. Numerous examples of Mudéjar art exist in ceramics and textiles, as well as in architectural monuments such as the synagogues of
     <xref articleid="72794">

     and the Alcazba in

     (Seville), where even the name of the ruling Christian prince, Don Pedro, was written in Arabic letters. The Mudéjar spirit, in fact, permeated most of Spanish architectural ornament and decorative arts for centuries, and its influence can even be found in Spanish America.

Dating mostly from the 10th and 11th centuries, the celebrated illuminations for the commentary on the Revelation to John by an 8th-century Spanish abbot, Beatus of Liébana, are purely Christian subjects treated in styles possibly influenced by Muslim miniature painting or book illustration.

     During the Mamluk period Egypt and Syria were rich commercial emporiums. This wealth explains the quality and quantity of Mamluk art. Most of the existing monuments in the old quarters of

     </xref>
     , is Mamluk. Museum collections of Islamic art generally abound with Mamluk metalwork and glass. Some of the oldest remaining carpets are Mamluk. This creativity required, of course, more than wealth. It also required a certain will to transform wealth into art. This will was in part the desire of parvenu rulers and their cohorts to be remembered. Furthermore, architectural patronage flourished because of the institutionalization of the
     <e type="italic">
      waqf
     </e>
     , an economic system in which investments made for holy purposes were inalienable. This law allowed the wealthy to avoid confiscation of their properties at the whim of the caliph by investing their funds in religious institutions. In the Mamluk period, therefore, there was a multiplication of madrasahs,

     s,
     <e type="italic">

     s, and mosques, often with tombs of founders attached to them. The Mamluk establishment also repaired and kept up all the institutions, religious or secular, that had been inherited by them, as can be demonstrated by the well-documented repairs carried on in Jerusalem and Damascus.

      The Mamluks created a monumental setting for Syria and Egypt that has lasted into the 21st century. It was at its most remarkable in architecture, and nearly 3,000 major monuments have been preserved or are known from texts in cities from the Euphrates to Cairo. No new architectural types came into being, although many more urban commercial buildings and private houses have been preserved than from previous centuries. The hypostyle form continued to be used for mosques and oratories, as in the Cairene mosques of
      <xref articleid="13863">

      (1262–63), Nāṣir (1335), and Muʾayyad Shaykh (1415–20).

      s in the Islamic world. Mausoleums were squares or polygons covered with domes. In other words, there were only minor modifications in the typology of architecture, and even the 15th-century buildings with interiors totally covered with ornamentation have possible prototypes in the architecture of the Seljuqs. Yet there are formal and functional features that do distinguish Mamluk buildings. One is the tendency to build structures of different functions in a complex or cluster. Thus, the
      <xref articleid="62097">
       Qalāʾūn mosque
      </xref>
      (1284–85) in Cairo has a mausoleum, a madrasah, and a hospital erected as one architectural unit. Another characteristic is the tendency of Mamluk patrons to build their major monuments near each other. As a result, certain streets of
      <xref articleid="106112">
       Cairo
      </xref>
      , such as Bayn al-Qaṣrayn, became galleries of architectural masterpieces. The plans of those buildings may have had to be adapted to the exigencies of the city, but their spectacular facades and minarets competed with each other for effect. From the second half of the 14th century onward, building space for mausoleums began to be limited in Cairo, and a vast complex of commemorative monuments was created in the city’s western cemetery. In Aleppo and Damascus similar phenomena can be observed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although Mamluk architecture was essentially conservative in its development of building types, more originality is evident in the constructional systems used, although traditional structural features continued to be employed—e.g., cupolas raised on squinches, or more commonly, pendentives, barrel and groin vaults, and wooden ceilings covering large areas supported by columns and piers. The main innovations are of three kinds. First,
      <xref articleid="52803">
       minarets
      </xref>
      became particularly elaborate and, toward the end of the period, almost absurd in their ornamentation. Facades were huge, with overwhelming portals 25 to 35 feet (7.5 to 10.5 metres) high.

      A second characteristically Mamluk feature was technical virtuosity in
      <xref articleid="69794">
       stone
      </xref>
      construction. At times this led to a superb purity of form, as in the Gate of the Cotton Merchants in
      <xref articleid="106455">
       Jerusalem
      </xref>
      or the complex of the Barqūq mosque in Cairo. At other times, as in the Mamluk architecture of Baybars and Qāʾit Bāy, there was an almost wild playfulness with forms. Another aspect of Mamluk
      <xref articleid="51279">
       masonry
      </xref>
      was the alternation of stones of different colours to provide variations on the surfaces of buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The third element of change in Mamluk art was perhaps the most important: almost all formal artistic achievements rapidly became part of the common vocabulary of the whole culture, thus ensuring high quality of construction and decorative technique throughout the period.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of portals and
      <e type="italic">
       qiblah
      </e>
      walls, architectural decoration was usually subordinated to the architectural elements of the design. Generally, the material of construction (usually stone) was carved with ornamental motifs. Stucco decoration was primarily used in early Mamluk architecture, while coloured tile was a late decorative device that was rarely employed.

      (1334) in the National Library, Vienna, display an amazing ornamental sense in the use of colour on gold backgrounds. Mamluk mosque lamps provide some of the finest examples of medieval glass. The wooden objects made by Mamluk craftsmen were widely celebrated for the quality of their painted, inlaid, or carved designs. And the bold inscriptions that decorate the hundreds of remaining bronzes testify to the Mamluk mastery of calligraphy.

     Mongol Iran: Il-Khanid and Timurid periods
    </title>
    <p>
     Seen from the vantage point of contemporary or later chronicles, the 13th century in Iran was a period of destructive wars and invasions. Such cities as Balkh, Nīshāpūr, and Rayy, which had been centres of Islamic culture for nearly six centuries, were eradicated as the Mongol army swept through Iran. The turning point toward some sort of stability took place in 1295 with the accession of
     <xref articleid="36673">
      Maḥmūd Ghāzān
     </xref>
     to the Mongol throne. Under him and his successors (the
     <xref articleid="42112">

     ), order was reestablished throughout Iran, and cities in northeastern Iran, especially
     <xref articleid="70851">
      Tabrīz
     </xref>
     and Solṭānīyeh, became the main creative centres of the new Mongol regime. At Tabrīz, for example, the Rashīdīyeh (a sort of academy of sciences and arts to which books, scholars, and ideas from all over the world were collected) was established in the early 14th century.

     Existing under the Mongol rulers were a number of secondary dynasties that flourished in various provinces of Iran: the
     <xref articleid="43275">

     </xref>
     , centred in Baghdad, controlled most of western Iran; the

     and

     , became focal points of artistic and intellectual activity. But Timurid culture affected the whole of Iran either directly or through minor local dynasties. Many Timurid monuments, therefore, are found in western or southern Iran.

      Stylistically, Il-Khanid architecture is defined best by buildings such as the mosque of Varāmīn (1322–26) and the mausoleums at Sarakhs,
      <xref articleid="52191">
       Merv

      , Rād-Kān, and
      <xref articleid="50730">
       Marāgheh
      </xref>
      . In all those examples, the elements of architectural composition, decoration, and construction that had been developed earlier were refined by Il-Khanid architects.
      <e type="italic">
       Eyvān
      </e>
      s were shallower but better integrated with the courts, facades were more thoughtfully composed, the
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      became more linear and varied, and coloured tiles were used to enhance the building’s character.
     </p>
     <p>
      The architectural masterpiece of the Il-Khanid period is the mausoleum of
      <xref articleid="57040">
       Öljeitü
      </xref>
      at Solṭāniyyeh. With its double system of galleries, eight minarets, large blue-tiled dome, and an interior measuring 80 feet (25 metres), it is clear that the building was intended to be imposing. Il-Khanid attention to impressiveness of scale also accounted for the ʿAlī Shāh mosque in Tabrīz, whose
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      measuring 150 by 80 by 100 feet (45 by 25 by 30 metres) was meant to be the largest ever built. The
      <e type="italic">
       eyvān
      </e>
      vault collapsed almost immediately after it had been constructed, but its walls, 35 feet (10 metres) thick, remain as a symbol of the grandiose taste of the Il-Khanids. In the regions of Eṣfahān and Yazd numerous smaller mosques (often with unusual plans) and less ostentatious mausoleums, as well as palaces with elaborate gardens, were built in the 14th century. Those buildings were constructed to provide a monumental setting for the Islamic faith and to demonstrate the authority of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Timurid period began architecturally in 1390 with the sanctuary of Aḥmad Yasavī in Turkistan. Between 1390 and the last works of Sultan Ḥusayn Bāyqarā almost a century later, hundreds of buildings were constructed at Herāt, many of which have been preserved. The most spectacular examples of Timurid architecture are found in Samarkand, Herāt, Mashhad, Khargird, Tayābād,
      <xref articleid="11883">
       Baku
      </xref>
      , and Tabrīz, although important Timurid structures were also erected in southern Iran.
     </p>
     <p>
      Architectural projects were well patronized by the Timurids as a means to commemorate their respective reigns. Every ruler or local governor constructed his own sanctuaries, mosques, and, especially, memorial buildings dedicated to holy men of the past. While the Shāh-e Zendah in Samarkand—a long street of mausoleums comparable to the Mamluk cemetery of Cairo—is perhaps the most accessible of the sites of Timurid commemorative architecture, more spectacular ones are to be seen at
      <xref articleid="52206">
       Mashhad
      </xref>
      , Torbat-e Jām, and
      <xref articleid="51627">
       Mazār-e Sharīf
      </xref>
      . The Timurid princes also erected mausoleums for themselves, such as the Gūr-e Amīr and the ʿIshrat-Khāneh in Samarkand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major Timurid buildings—such as the mosque of Bībī Khānom and the Gūr-e Amīr mausoleum, both in Samarkand; the mosque of Gowhar Shād in Mashhad; or the madrasahs at Khargird and Herāt—are all characterized by strong axial symmetry. Often the facade on the inner court repeats the design of the outer facade, and minarets are used to frame the composition. Changes took place in the technique of
      <xref articleid="30852">
       dome
      </xref>
      construction. The
      <e type="italic">
       muqarnas
      </e>
      was not entirely abandoned but was often replaced by a geometrically rigorous net of intersecting arches that could be adapted to various shapes by modifying the width or span of the dome. The Khargird madrasah and the ʿIshrat-Khāneh mausoleum in Samarkand are particularly striking examples of this structural development. The Timurids also made use of double domes on high drums.

      In the Timurid period the use of colour in architecture reached a high point. Every architectural unit was divided, on both the exterior and interior, into panels of brilliantly coloured tiles that sometimes were mixed with stucco or terra-cotta architectural decorations.

      A new period of Persian painting began in the Mongol era; even though here and there one can recognize the impact of Seljuq painting, on the whole it is a limited one. Although the new style was primarily expressed in miniature painting, it is known from literary sources that mural painting flourished as well. Masterpieces of Persian literature were illustrated: first the

      and then, from the second half of the 14th century, lyrical and mystical works, primarily those by the 12th-century poet
      <xref articleid="55636">

      . Historical texts or chronicles such as Rashīd al-Dīn’s

      Chinese influence can still be discovered in the masterpiece of 14th-century Persian painting, the so-called Demotte
      <e type="italic">

       Shāh-nāmeh
      </e>
      . Illustrated between 1320 and 1360, its 56 preserved miniatures have been dispersed all over the world. The compositional complexity of those paintings can be attributed to the fact that several painters probably were involved in the illustration of the manuscript and that the artists drew from a wide variety of different stylistic sources (e.g., Chinese, European, local Iranian traditions). Its main importance lies in the fact that it is the earliest known illustrative work that sought to depict in a strikingly dramatic fashion the meaning of the Iranian epic. Its battle scenes, its descriptions of fights with monsters, its enthronement scenes are all powerful representations of the colourful and often cruel legend of Iranian kingship. The artists also tried to express human powerlessness when confronted by fate in a series of mourning and death scenes.

At the very end of the period, a manuscript such as that of the poems of Sultan Aḥmad still exhibits an effective variety of established themes, while some of the miniatures of the period illustrate the astounding variety of styles studied or copied by Persian masters.

      <e type="italic">

      s are known from this time, the mood of those manuscripts is no longer epic but lyrical. Puppetlike figures almost unemotionally engage in a variety of activities always set in an idealized garden or palace depicted against a rich gold background. It is a world of sensuous pleasure that also embodies the themes of a mystically interpreted lyrical poetry, for what is represented is not the real world but a divine paradise in the guise of a royal palace or garden. Those miniatures easily became clichés, for later artists endlessly repeated stereotyped formulas. But at its best, as in the illustrated manuscripts of

      </xref>
      , this style of Persian painting succeeds in defining something more than mere ornamental colourfulness. It expresses in its controlled lyricism a fascinating search for the divine, similar to the search of such epic characters as those presented in the works of Neẓāmī,
      <xref articleid="43269">

      Another major change in Persian painting occurred during the second half of the 15th century at Herāt under Ḥusayn Bāyqarā. This change is associated with the first major painter of Islamic art,
      <xref articleid="15141">

      ), the Egyptian Cairo National Library’s Būstān (1488), or the British Museum’s Neẓāmī (1493–94), the stereotyped formulas of the earlier lyric style were endowed with new vitality. Behzād’s interest in observing his environment resulted in the introduction of more realistic poses and the introduction of numerous details of daily life or genre elements. His works also reflect a concern for a psychological interpretation of the scenes and events depicted. It is thus not by chance that portraits have been attributed to Behzād.

      Persian art of the Mongol period differs in a very important way from any of the other traditions of the middle period of Islamic art. Even though Iran, like all other areas at that time, was not ethnically homogeneous, its art tended to be uniquely “national.” In architecture, nationalism was mostly a matter of function, for during this period the Shiʿah grew in importance, and new monumental settings were required for their holy places. Iranian individualism is especially apparent in painting, in which Chinese and other foreign styles were consistently adapted to express intensely Iranian subjects, thereby creating a uniquely Persian style.

      The grand tradition of Ottoman architecture, established in the 16th century, was derived from two main sources. One was the rather complex development of new architectural forms that occurred all over Anatolia, especially at

      <xref articleid="18231">
       Bursa
      </xref>
      , and Selçuk in the 14th and early 15th centuries. In addition to the usual mosques, mausoleums, and madrasahs, a number of buildings called
      <e type="italic">
       tekke
      </e>
      s (Arabic
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      s, Persian
      <e type="italic">

      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      (or
      <e type="italic">

      ) was often joined to a mosque or mausoleum. The entire complex was then called a
      <e type="italic">
       külliye
      </e>
      . All those buildings continued to develop the domed, central-plan structure constructed by the Seljuqs in Anatolia.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other source of Ottoman architecture is Christian art. The
      <xref articleid="471947">
       Byzantine
      </xref>
      tradition, especially as embodied in
      <xref articleid="38782">
       Hagia Sophia
      </xref>
      , became a major source of inspiration. Byzantine influence appears in such features as stone and brick used together or in the use of
      <xref articleid="59051">
       pendentive
      </xref>
      dome construction. Also artistically influential were the contacts that the early Ottomans had with Italy. Thus, in several mosques at Bursa, Turkey, there are stylistic parallels in the designs of the exterior facade and of windows, gates, and roofs to features found in Italian architecture. A distinctive feature of Ottoman architecture is that it drew from both Islamic and European artistic traditions and was, therefore, a part of both.
     </p>
     <p>
      The apogee of Ottoman architecture was achieved in the great series of
      <e type="italic">
       külliye
      </e>
      s and mosques that still dominate the Istanbul skyline: the Fatih
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      (1463–70), the Bayezid Mosque (after 1491), the Selim Mosque (1522), the Şehzade
      <e type="italic">

      (1548), and the Süleyman
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      (after 1550). The Şehzade and Süleyman
      <e type="italic">

      </e>
      s were built by
      <xref articleid="67893">
       Sinan
      </xref>
      , the greatest Ottoman architect, whose masterpiece is the Selim Mosque at
      <xref articleid="32004">
       Edirne
      </xref>
      , Turkey (1569–75). All those buildings exhibit total clarity and logic in both plan and elevation; every part has been considered in relation to the whole, and each architectural element has acquired a hierarchic function in the total composition. Whatever is unnecessary has been eliminated. This simplicity of design in the late 15th and 16th centuries has often been attributed to the fact that Sinan and many other Ottoman architects were first trained as military engineers. Everything in those buildings was subordinated to an imposing central dome. A sort of cascade of descending half domes, vaults, and ascending buttresses leads the eye up and down the building’s exterior. Minarets, slender and numerous, frame the exterior composition, while the open space of the surrounding courts prevents the building from being swallowed by the surrounding city. These masterpieces of Ottoman architecture seem to be the final perfection of two great traditions: a stylistic and aesthetic tradition that had been indigenous to Istanbul since the construction of the Byzantine church of Hagia Sophia in the 6th century and the other Islamic tradition of domical construction dating to the 10th century.

      The tragedy of Ottoman architecture is that it never managed to renew its 16th-century brilliance. Later buildings, such as the impressive Sultan Ahmed mosque in Istanbul, were mostly variations on Sinan’s architecture, and sometimes there were revivals of older building types, especially in the provinces. Occasionally, as in the early 18th-century Nûruosman mosque in Istanbul, interesting new variants appear illustrating the little-known Turkish Baroque style. The latter, however, is more visible in ornamental details or in smaller buildings, especially the numerous fountains built in Istanbul in the 18th century. The sources of the Turkish Baroque are probably to be sought in the

      Architectural decoration was generally subordinated to the structural forms or architectonic features of the building. A wide variety of themes and techniques originating from many different sources were used. One decorative device, the Ottoman version of colour tile decoration, deserves particular mention, for it succeeds in transforming smaller buildings such as the mosque of Rüstem Paşa in Istanbul into a visual spectacle of brilliant colours. The history and development of this type of ceramic decoration is intimately tied to the complex and much-controverted problem of the growth of several distinctive Ottoman schools of pottery: İznik, Rhodian, and Damascus ware. Both in technique and in design, Ottoman ceramics are the only major examples of pottery produced in the late Islamic period.

      Ottoman miniature painting does not compare in quality to Persian painting, which originally influenced the Turkish school. Yet Ottoman miniatures do have a character of their own, either in the almost folk art effect of religious images or in the precise depictions of such daily events as military expeditions or great festivals. Among the finest examples of the latter is the manuscript

     The Safavid dynasty was founded by
     <xref articleid="42930">
      Ismāʿīl I
     </xref>
     (ruled 1501–24). The art of this dynasty was especially noteworthy during the reigns of

     (1524–76) and
     <xref articleid="3233">
      ʿAbbās I
     </xref>
     (1588–1629). This phase of the Safavid period also marked the last significant development of Islamic art in Iran, for after the middle of the 17th century original creativity disappeared in all mediums. Rugs and objects in silver, gold, and enamel continued to be made and exhibited a considerable technical virtuosity, even when they were lacking in inventiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Safavids abandoned Central Asia and northeastern Iran to a new Uzbek dynasty that maintained the Timurid style in many buildings (especially at Bukhara) and briefly sponsored a minor and derivative school of painting. Only the great sanctuary of Mashhad was being kept up and built up, but, like many of the other religious sanctuaries of the time—

     —it is still far too little known to lend itself to coherent analysis. This was the time when Shiʿism became a state religion, and for the first time in Islam there appeared an organized ecclesiastical system rather than the more or less loose spiritual and practical leadership of old. The main centres of the Safavid empire were Tabrīz and Ardabīl in the northwest, with Kazvin in the central region and, especially, Eṣfahān in the west. The Safavid period, like the Ottoman era, was an imperial age, and therefore there is hardly a part of Iran where either Safavid buildings or major Safavid restorations cannot be found. The dynasty spent much money and effort on the building of bridges, roads, and caravansaries to encourage trade.

    <h4 id="h13863">
     <title>
      Architecture
     </title>
     <p>
      The best-known Safavid monuments are located at Eṣfahān, where ʿAbbās I built a whole new city. According to one description, it contained 162 mosques, 48 madrasahs, 1,802 commercial buildings, and 283 baths. Most of those buildings no longer survive, but the structures that remain constitute some of the finest monuments of Islamic architecture.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the centre of Eṣfahān is the Maydān-e Shāh (now Maydān-e Emām), a large open space, about 1,670 by 520 feet (510 by 158 metres), originally surrounded by trees. Used for polo games and parades, it could be illuminated with 50,000 lamps. Each side of the
      <e type="italic">
       maydān
      </e>
      was provided with the monumental facade of a building. On one of the smaller sides was the entrance to a large mosque, the celebrated Masjed-e Shāh (now Masjed-e Emām). On the other side was the entrance into the bazaar or marketplace. On the longer sides were the small funerary mosque of Shaykh Luṭf Allāh (Sheikh Lotfollāh) and, facing it, the ʿAlī Qāpū, the “Lofty Gate,” the first unit of a succession of palaces and gardens that extended beyond the
      <e type="italic">
       maydān
      </e>
      , most of which have now disappeared except for the Chehel Sotūn (“Forty Columns”), a palace built as an audience hall. The ʿAlī Qāpū was, in its lower floors, a semipublic place to which petitions could be brought, while its upper floors were a world of pure fantasy—a succession of rooms, halls, and balconies overlooking the city, which were purely for the prince’s pleasure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Maydān-e Emām unites in a single composition all the concerns of medieval Islamic architecture: prayer, commemoration, princely pleasure, trade, and spatial effect. None of the hundreds of other remaining Safavid monuments can match its historical importance, and in it also are found the major traits of Safavid construction and decoration. The forms are traditional, for the most part, and, even in vaulting techniques and the use of coloured tiles, it is to Timurid art that the Safavids looked for their models. The Persian architects of the early 17th century sought to achieve a monumentality in exterior spatial composition (an interesting parallel to the interior spaciousness created at the same time by the Ottomans); a logical precision in vaulting, which was successful in the Masjed-e Emām but rapidly led to cheap effects or to stucco imitations; and a colouristic brilliance that has made the domes and portals of Eṣfahān justly famous.

      Painting

     <p>
      In the 16th and 17th centuries, possibly for the first time in Islamic art, painters were conscious of historical styles—even self-conscious. Miniatures from the past were collected, copied, and imitated. Patronage, however, was fickle. A royal whim would gather painters together or exile them. Many names of painters have been preserved, and there is little doubt that the whim of patrons was being countered by the artists’ will to be socially and economically independent as well as individually recognized for their artistic talents. Too many different impulses, therefore, existed in Safavid Iran for painting to follow any clear line of development.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three major painting styles, or schools (excluding a number of interesting provincial schools), existed in the Safavid period. One school of miniature painting is exemplified by such masterpieces as the Houghton

      <xref articleid="38754">
       Ḥāfeẓ
      </xref>
      . However different they are from each other, those large, colourful miniatures all were executed in a grand manner. Their compositions are complex, individual faces appear in crowded masses, there is much diversification in landscape, and, despite a few ferocious details of monsters or of strongly caricatured poses and expressions, these book illustrations are concerned with an idealized vision of life. The sources of this school lie with the Timurid academy.

      The miniatures of the second tradition of Safavid painting seem at first to be like a detail out of the work of the previously discussed school. The same purity of colour, elegance of poses, interest in details, and assertion of the individual figure is found. Rezā ʿAbbāsī (active in the late 16th and early 17th century) excelled in these extraordinary portrayals of poets, musicians, courtiers, and aristocratic life in general.
     </p>
     <p>
      In both traditions of painting, the beautiful personages depicted frequently are satirized; this note of satirical criticism is even more pronounced in portraiture of the time. But it is in pen or brush drawings, mostly dating from the 17th century, that the third aspect of Safavid painting appeared: an interest in genre, or the depiction of minor events of daily life (e.g., a washerwoman at work, a tailor sewing, an animal). With stunning precision, Safavid artists showed a whole society falling apart with a cruel sympathy totally absent from the literary documents of the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      While architecture and painting were the main artistic vehicles of the Safavids, the making of textiles and carpets was also of great importance. It is in the 16th century that a thitherto primarily nomadic and folk medium of the decorative arts was transformed into an expression of royal and urban tasks by the creation of court workshops. The predominantly geometric themes of earlier Iranian carpets were not abandoned entirely but tended to be replaced by vegetal, animal, and even occasional human motifs. Great schools of carpet making developed particularly at

     Mughal art

     <xref articleid="105952">

     </xref>
     traditions of the Indian subcontinent, their art will be treated only synoptically in this article. (For a more-detailed account, the reader should see the sections on Mughal art in the visual arts of the Indian subcontinent portion of the article South Asian arts, notably

     </xref>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     The art of the Mughals was similar to that of the Ottomans in that it was a late imperial art of Muslim princes. Both styles were rooted in several centuries (at least from the 13th century onward) of adaptation of Islamic functions to indigenous forms. It was in the 14th-century architecture of South Asian sites such as Tughluqabad, Gaur, and Ahmadabad that a uniquely Indian type of Islamic hypostyle mosque was created, with a triple axial nave, corner towers, axial minarets, and cupolas. It was also during those centuries that the first mausoleums set in scenically spectacular locations were built. By then the conquering Muslims had fully learned how to utilize local methods of construction, and they adapted South Asian decorative techniques and motifs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mughal art was in continuous contact with Iran or, rather, with the
     <xref articleid="72546">
      Timurid
     </xref>
     world of the second half of the 15th century. The models and the memories were in Herāt or Samarkand, but the artists were raided from Safavid Iran, and the continuous flow of painters from Iran to the Mughal Empire is a key factor in understanding Mughal painting.

     (1631–53; in 1983 designated a World Heritage site) summarize the development of Mughal architecture. In all three examples it can be seen that what Mughal architecture brought to the Islamic tradition (other than traditional Indian themes, especially in decoration) was technical perfection in the use of red
     <xref articleid="65483">
      sandstone
     </xref>
     or marble as building and decorative materials.
    </p>
    <p>
     In Mughal painting, the kind of subject that tended to be illustrated was remarkably close to those used in Safavid history books—legendary stories, local events, portraits, genre scenes. What evolved quickly was a new manner of execution, and this style can be seen as early as about 1567, when the celebrated manuscript
     <e type="italic">
      Dāstān-e Amīr Ḥamzeh
     </e>
     (“Stories of Amīr Ḥamzeh”) was painted (some 200 miniatures remain and are found in most major collections of Indian miniatures, especially at the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). Traditional Iranian themes—battles, receptions, feasts—acquired monumentality, not only because of the inordinate size of the images but also because almost all of the objects and figures depicted were seen in terms of mass rather than line. Something of the colourfulness of Iranian painting was lost, but instead images acquired a greater expressive power. Mughal portraiture gave more of a sense of the individual than did the portraits of the Safavids. As in a celebrated representation of a dying courtier in the Boston
     <xref articleid="34284">
      Museum of Fine Arts
     </xref>
     , Mughal drawings could be poignantly naturalistic. Mood was important to the Mughal artist; in many paintings of animals there is a playful mood, and a sensuous mood is evident in the first Muslim images to glorify the female body and the erotic.
    </p>
    <p>
     In summary it can be said that the Mughals produced an art of extraordinary stylistic contrasts that reflected the complexities of its origins and of its aristocratic patronage.

    Islamic art under European influence and contemporary trends
   </title>
   <p>
    It is extremely difficult to decide when, how, and to what extent European art began to affect the art of the traditional Muslim world. Ottoman architecture was from the beginning affected by Western influences. In Mughal India, European landscapes and Western spatial concerns influenced painting in the 18th century, and Persian painting has exhibited constant Western influence since the 17th century. Thus, Islamic art began to be affected by European traditions before Europe began (in the 18th and 19th centuries) its conquests of most of the Muslim world. Because the Ottomans ruled North Africa (except Morocco), Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, as well as the Balkans, much of the Muslim world was first introduced to “modern” European art through its adaptation in
    <xref articleid="106446">
     Istanbul
    </xref>
    or in other major Ottoman cities such as Smyrna (now
    <xref articleid="43106">
     İzmir
    </xref>
    ) or
    <xref articleid="106079">
     Alexandria
    </xref>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    European influence tended to have been mostly limited to architecture. Nineteenth-century European engineers and architects, for example, adapted modern structural technology and decorative styles to local Islamic needs or idioms: the Sūq al-Ḥamīdiyyah bazaar in Damascus was built with steel roofing; the Hejaz railway station at Damascus was decorated in a sort of Eastern Art Nouveau style.
   </p>
   <p>
    During actual European occupation of Muslim territory, there was a conscious revival of traditional decorative arts, but new techniques were often employed. This especially occurred in India and Morocco, where the retail success of an art object depended less on the local tradition than on the taste of the Europeans. What was romantic to a European, therefore, was no longer part of the world of the newly enriched and Europeanized Muslim. Much of the Europeanized architecture was drab and pretentious. The only real artistic accomplishment of this period was in the preservation and encouragement of the traditional techniques and designs of the decorative arts, which often had to be maintained artificially through government subsidies.
   </p>
   <p>
    During the period of occupation it was questioned whether alien techniques necessarily brought with them new forms. This mood was clearly expressed in literature but less so in the visual arts, because the quality of Muslim art had deteriorated so much in the decades preceding European arrival that there was no longer a lively creative force to maintain. As various schools based on the
    <xref articleid="14011">
     École des Beaux-Arts
    </xref>
    in Paris were formed, however, the faculties and the students suffered from constant uncertainty as to whether they should preserve an art that was mostly artisanal or revolutionize it altogether.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is much more difficult to define in broad terms the characteristics of art in Muslim countries after the formation of independent countries in the 1940s and ’50s. Extensive planning programs and building projects were undertaken in even the poorest countries, and the wealthy Arab states as well as prerevolutionary Iran transformed their traditional cities and countryside with spectacular modern complexes ranging from housing projects to universities. Many of those buildings were planned and constructed by Western firms and architects, and some are mere copies of European and American models, ill-adapted to the physical conditions and visual traditions of the Muslim world. Others are interesting and even sensitive projects: spectacular and technically innovative, such as the InterContinental Hotel in Mecca (designed by German architects Rolf Gutbrod and
    <xref articleid="623870">
     Frei Otto
    </xref>
    ) and the Hajj Terminal at the King Abdulaziz International Airport at
    <xref articleid="43628">
     Jeddah
    </xref>
    , Saudi Arabia (designed by the U.S. firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill); or intelligent and imaginative, such as the government buildings of
    <xref articleid="30205">
     Dhaka
    </xref>
    , Bangladesh (designed by American architect
    <xref articleid="44319">
     Louis I. Kahn
    </xref>
    ), or the numerous buildings designed by Frenchman André Ravereau in Mali and Algeria. Furthermore, within the Muslim world emerged several schools of architects that adopted modes of an international language to suit local conditions. The oldest of those schools are in Turkey.
   </p>
   <p>
    Major Muslim contributors to a contemporary Islamic architecture include the Iranians Nader Ardalan and Kamran Diba, the Iraqis Rifat Chaderji and Mohamed Makiya, the Jordanian Rasem Badran, and the Bangladeshi Mazharul Islam. A unique message was transmitted by the visionary Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy, who, in eloquent and prophetic terms, urged that the traditional forms and techniques of vernacular architecture be studied and adapted to contemporary needs. Directly or indirectly, his work inspired many young architects in the Muslim world and led to a host of fascinating private houses, mosques, and educational facilities. The Aga Khan Award for Architecture was instituted to encourage genuine and contemporary architectural innovation in Muslim lands.
