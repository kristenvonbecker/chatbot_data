  HeLa cells are a common source of cross-contamination of other cell lines and a suspected cause of numerous instances of cell line misidentification. The HeLa cell genome has also been shown to be highly unstable, housing numerous genomic rearrangements (e.g., abnormal numbers of

  ) in a phenomenon known as chromothripsis.
