   wheel lock
  </e>
  , device for igniting the powder in a firearm such as a musket. It was developed in about 1515. The wheel lock struck a spark to ignite powder on the pan of a musket. It did so by means of a holder that pressed a shard of flint or a piece of iron pyrite against an iron wheel with a milled edge; the wheel was rotated and sparks flew. The principle was used in the design of the flint-and-wheel cigarette lighter.
