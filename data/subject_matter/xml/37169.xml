   Thomas Godfrey

  , (born December 1704, Bristol Township, Pa.—died December 1749, Philadelphia), British-American colonial artisan, inventor, and mathematician.

  Godfrey became a glazier during his youth and later installed the windows in Philadelphia’s state house, now Independence Hall. He was also employed at the residence of the colonial statesman and botanist James Logan, who encouraged Godfrey’s talents in mathematics and science. Godfrey soon undertook the development of an improved quadrant for determining latitude. He carried out much of his work in part of a home that he rented from Benjamin Franklin. Godfrey completed his quadrant in 1730; its accuracy was subsequently proved during voyages in Delaware Bay and in the Atlantic Ocean to Jamaica.

  Godfrey’s invention was challenged by James Hadley, vice president of the Royal Society in London, who had developed a similar quadrant. In December 1734 Godfrey, with the support of Logan, wrote to the society, claiming recognition as the original inventor, but his claims were not acknowledged.

  Godfrey’s son, Thomas (1736–63), won notice as a colonial playwright and poet.
