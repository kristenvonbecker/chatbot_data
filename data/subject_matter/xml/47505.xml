   Monocirrhus polyacanthus,
  </e>
  a South American species that is known for its close resemblance in both appearance and swimming behaviour to a dead, drifting leaf. This species is about 7.5 cm (3 inches) long and is coloured a mottled brown; it has serrated dorsal and anal fins that resemble the saw edges of leaves and a chin barbel that looks like a broken leaf stem. It lives in quiet waters, drifting about, often head down, and propelling itself with a transparent tail and pectoral fins. When feeding, it awaits an unsuspecting small fish or moves toward it slowly, taking it with a sudden gape of the huge mouth. Many members of the Nandidae family are popular aquarium fishes.
