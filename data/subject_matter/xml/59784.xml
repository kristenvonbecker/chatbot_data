  , one of several oxygen acids of phosphorus, used as reducing agent in chemical analysis. It is a colourless or yellowish crystalline substance (melting point about 73° C, or 163° F) with a garliclike taste. An unstable compound that readily absorbs moisture, it is converted to phosphoric acid (H
