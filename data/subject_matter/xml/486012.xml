  A wildly imaginative fantasy of the Parisian underworld, the novel tells the story of Divine, a male prostitute who consorts with thieves, pimps, murderers, and other criminals and who has many sexual adventures. Written in lyrical, dreamlike prose, the novel moves back and forth in time, opening with Divine’s funeral. Genet affirms a new moral order, one in which criminals are saints, evil is glorified, and conventional taboos are freely violated.
