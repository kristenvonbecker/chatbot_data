    , nitrogen dioxide, and
    <xref articleid="20252">

    </xref>
    that are burned in power plants, automobiles, and other combustion sources.
    <xref articleid="57878">
     Ozone
    </xref>
    (a key component of
    <xref articleid="68319">

    </xref>
    ) is also a gaseous pollutant; it forms in the atmosphere via complex chemical reactions occurring between nitrogen dioxide and various volatile organic compounds (e.g., gasoline vapours).
   </p>
   <p>
    Airborne suspensions of extremely small solid or liquid particles called “particulates” (e.g., soot, dust, smokes, fumes, mists), especially those less than 10 micrometres (μm; millionths of a metre) in size, are significant air pollutants because of their very harmful effects on human health. They are emitted by various industrial processes, coal- or oil-burning power plants, residential heating systems, and automobiles.
    <xref articleid="47492">
     Lead
    </xref>
    fumes (airborne particulates less than 0.5 μm in size) are particularly toxic and are an important pollutant of many
    <xref articleid="104236">
     diesel fuels
    </xref>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Except for lead, criteria pollutants are emitted in industrialized countries at very high rates, typically measured in millions of tons per year. All except ozone are discharged directly into the atmosphere from a wide variety of sources. They are regulated primarily by establishing ambient air quality standards, which are maximum acceptable concentrations of each criteria pollutant in the atmosphere, regardless of its origin. The six criteria pollutants are described in turn below.
   </p>
   <h3 id="h286155">
    <title>
     Fine particulates
    </title>
    <p>
     Very small fragments of solid materials or liquid droplets suspended in air are called particulates. Except for airborne lead, which is treated as a separate category, they are characterized on the basis of size and phase (i.e., solid or liquid) rather than by chemical composition. For example, solid particulates between roughly 1 and 100 μm in diameter are called dust particles, whereas airborne solids less than 1 μm in diameter are called fumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The particulates of most concern with regard to their effects on human health are solids less than 10 μm in diameter, because they can be inhaled deep into the
     <xref articleid="49375">
      lungs

     and become trapped in the lower respiratory system. Certain particulates, such as

     fibres, are known carcinogens (
     <xref articleid="106118">

    Air toxics
   </title>
   <p>
    Hundreds of specific substances are considered hazardous when present in trace amounts in the air. These pollutants are called air toxics. Many of them cause genetic mutations or
    <xref articleid="106118">
     cancer
    </xref>
    ; some cause other types of health problems, such as adverse effects on brain tissue or fetal development. Although the total emissions and the number of sources of air toxics are small compared with those for criteria pollutants, these pollutants can pose an immediate health risk to exposed individuals and can cause other environmental problems.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most air toxics are

The risk of accidental release of very hazardous substances into the air is generally higher for people living in industrialized urban areas. Hundreds of such incidents occur each year, though none has been as severe as the Bhopal event.

    Other than in cases of occupational exposure or accidental release, health threats from air toxics are greatest for people who live near large industrial facilities or in congested and polluted urban areas. Most major sources of air toxics are so-called point sources—that is, they have a specific location. Point sources include chemical plants, steel mills, oil refineries, and municipal waste incinerators. Hazardous air pollutants may be released when equipment leaks or when material is transferred, or they may be emitted from smokestacks. Municipal waste incinerators, for example, can emit hazardous levels of
    <xref articleid="30569">
     dioxins
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref articleid="34890">
     formaldehyde
    </xref>
    , and other organic substances, as well as metals such as arsenic, beryllium, lead, and mercury. Nevertheless, proper combustion along with appropriate
    <xref articleid="471033">
     air pollution control
    </xref>
    devices can reduce emissions of these substances to acceptable levels.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hazardous air pollutants also come from “area” sources, which are many smaller sources that release pollutants into the outdoor air in a defined area. Such sources include commercial
    <xref articleid="472231">
     dry-cleaning
    </xref>
    facilities, gasoline stations, small metal-plating operations, and woodstoves. Emission of air toxics from area sources are also regulated under some circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    Small area sources account for about 25 percent of all emissions of air toxics. Major point sources account for another 20 percent. The rest—more than half of hazardous air-pollutant emissions—come from motor vehicles. For example,
    <xref articleid="78683">
     benzene
    </xref>
    , a component of gasoline, is released as unburned fuel or as fuel vapours, and
    <xref articleid="34890">
     formaldehyde
    </xref>
    is one of the by-products of incomplete combustion. Newer cars, however, have emission control devices that significantly reduce the release of air toxics.

    is recognized by almost all atmospheric scientists as a significant environmental problem caused by an increase in levels of certain trace gases in the atmosphere since the beginning of the
    <xref articleid="42370">
     Industrial Revolution
    </xref>
    in the mid-18th century. These gases, collectively called
    <xref articleid="473968">
     greenhouse gases
    </xref>
    , include
    <xref articleid="20249">
     carbon dioxide
    </xref>
    , organic chemicals called
    <xref articleid="82249">
     chlorofluorocarbons

    (CFCs),
    <xref articleid="52328">

     nitrous oxide
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref articleid="57878">
     ozone
    </xref>
    , and many others. Carbon dioxide, although not the most potent of the greenhouse gases, is the most important because of the huge volumes emitted into the air by combustion of
    <xref articleid="35002">
     fossil fuels
    </xref>
    (e.g., gasoline, oil, coal).
   </p>
   <p>
    Carbon dioxide is considered a normal component of the atmosphere, and before the Industrial Revolution the average levels of this gas were about 280 parts per million (ppm). By 2020 the levels of carbon dioxide had reached 417 ppm, and they continue to increase at a rate of almost 3 ppm per year. Many scientists think that carbon dioxide should be regulated as a pollutant—a position taken by the EPA in 2009 in a ruling that such regulations could be promulgated. International cooperation and agreements, such as the Paris Agreement of 2015, would be necessary to reduce carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.

   Air pollution and air movement
  </title>
  <p>
   Local air quality typically varies over time because of the effect of
   <xref articleid="76362">
    weather
   </xref>
   patterns. For example, air pollutants are diluted and dispersed in a horizontal direction by prevailing
   <xref articleid="77159">
    winds
   </xref>
   , and they are dispersed in a vertical direction by atmospheric instability. Unstable atmospheric conditions occur when
   <xref articleid="5206">
    air masses
   </xref>
   move naturally in a vertical direction, thereby mixing and dispersing pollutants. When there is little or no vertical movement of air (stable conditions), pollutants can accumulate near the ground and cause temporary but acute episodes of air pollution. With regard to air quality, unstable atmospheric conditions are preferable to stable conditions.

   The degree of atmospheric instability depends on the temperature gradient (i.e., the rate at which air temperature changes with altitude). In the
   <xref articleid="73507">
    troposphere
   </xref>
   (the lowest layer of the atmosphere, where most weather occurs), air temperatures normally decrease as altitude increases; the faster the rate of decrease, the more unstable the atmosphere. Under certain conditions, however, a temporary “
   <xref articleid="71634">
    temperature inversion
   </xref>
   ” may occur, during which time the air temperature increases with increasing altitude, and the atmosphere is very stable. Temperature inversions prevent the upward mixing and dispersion of pollutants and are the major cause of air pollution episodes. Certain geographic conditions exacerbate the effect of inversions. For example, Los Angeles, situated on a plain on the Pacific coast of California and surrounded by mountains that block horizontal air motion, is particularly susceptible to the stagnation effects of inversions—hence the infamous Los Angeles
   <xref articleid="68319">
    smog
   </xref>
   . On the opposite coast of North America, another metropolis, New York City, produces greater quantities of pollutants than does Los Angeles but has been spared major air pollution disasters—only because of favourable climatic and geographic circumstances. During the mid-20th century, governmental efforts to reduce air pollution increased substantially after several major inversions, such as the
   <xref articleid="631937">
    Great Smog of London
   </xref>
   , a weeklong air pollution episode in London in 1952 that was directly blamed for more than 4,000 deaths.

   . For example,
   <xref articleid="3549">
    acid rain
   </xref>
   has gained worldwide attention since the 1970s as a regional and even continental problem. Acid rain occurs when
   <xref articleid="473414">
    sulfur dioxide
   </xref>
   and nitrogen oxides from the burning of
   <xref articleid="35002">

    sulfuric acid
   </xref>
   and
   <xref articleid="55938">
    nitric acid
   </xref>
   mists. The resulting acidic precipitation is damaging to water, forest, and soil resources. It has caused the disappearance of fish from many lakes in the
   <xref articleid="3739">
    Adirondack Mountains
   </xref>
   of North America, the widespread death of forests in mountains of Europe, and damage to tree growth in the United States and Canada. Acid rain can also corrode building materials and be hazardous to human health. These problems are not contained by political boundaries. Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels in the middle sections of the
   <xref articleid="111233">
    United States
   </xref>
   and
   <xref articleid="110588">
    Canada

   are precipitated as acid rain in the eastern regions of those countries, and acid rain in
   <xref articleid="106219">
    Norway
   </xref>
   comes largely from industrial areas in
   <xref articleid="37843">
    Great Britain

   and continental Europe. The international scope of the problem has led to the signing of international agreements on the limitation of sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions.

   Another global problem caused by air pollution is the

    ozone depletion
   </xref>
   in the
   <xref articleid="69919">
    stratosphere
   </xref>
   . At ground level (i.e., in the
   <xref articleid="73507">
    troposphere
   </xref>
   ), ozone is a pollutant, but at altitudes above 12 km (7 miles) it plays a crucial role in absorbing and thereby blocking
   <xref articleid="74181">
    ultraviolet radiation
   </xref>
   (UV) from the Sun before it reaches the ground. Exposure to UV radiation has been linked to
   <xref articleid="126102">
    skin cancer
   </xref>
   and other health problems. In 1985 it was discovered that a large “ozone hole,” an ozone-depleted region, is present every year between August and November over the continent of
   <xref articleid="109381">
    Antarctica
   </xref>
   . The size of this hole is increased by the presence in the atmosphere of
   <xref articleid="82249">
    chlorofluorocarbons
   </xref>
   (CFCs); these emanate from aerosol spray cans, refrigerators, industrial solvents, and other sources and are transported to Antarctica by atmospheric circulation. It had already been demonstrated in the mid-1970s that CFCs posed a threat to the global
   <xref articleid="57880">
    ozonosphere
   </xref>
   , and in 1978 the use of CFCs as propellants in aerosol cans was banned in the United States. Their use was subsequently restricted in several other countries. In 1987 representatives from more than 45 countries signed the
   <xref articleid="476866">
    Montreal Protocol
   </xref>
   , agreeing to place severe limitations on the production of CFCs. The efficacy of this legislation and global effort can be seen in the ozone layer’s continued recovery; in 2019 scientists recorded the smallest ozone hole above Antarctica since 1982.

   , particularly
   <xref articleid="37044">
    global warming
   </xref>
   . As a result of the growing worldwide consumption of fossil fuels,
   <xref articleid="20249">
    carbon dioxide
   </xref>
   levels in the atmosphere have increased steadily since 1900, and the rate of increase is accelerating. It has been estimated that if carbon dioxide levels are not reduced, average global air temperatures may rise another 4 °C (7.2 °F) by the end of the 21st century. Such a warming trend might cause melting of the polar ice caps, rising of the sea level, and flooding of the coastal areas of the world. Changes in precipitation patterns caused by global warming might have adverse effects on agriculture and forest ecosystems, and higher temperatures and humidity might increase the incidence of disease in humans and animals in some parts of the world. Implementation of international agreements on reducing greenhouse gases are required to protect global air quality and to mitigate the effects of global warming.

   Indoor air pollution
  </title>
  <p>
   Health risks related to indoor air pollution have become an issue of concern because people generally spend most of their time indoors at home and at work. The problem has been exacerbated by well-meaning efforts to lower air-exchange rates in buildings in order to conserve energy; these efforts unfortunately allow contaminants to accumulate indoors. Indoor air pollutants include various combustion products from stoves,
   <xref articleid="45165">
    kerosene
   </xref>
   space heaters, and fireplaces, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from household products (e.g., paints, cleaning agents, and pesticides).
   <xref articleid="34890">
    Formaldehyde
   </xref>
   off-gassing from building products (especially particleboard and plywood) and from dry-cleaned textiles can accumulate in indoor air.

   , and
   <xref articleid="60648">
    pollen
   </xref>
   are biological contaminants that can cause disease and other health problems, especially if they build up in and are spread by central heating or cooling systems. Environmental tobacco smoke, also called secondhand smoke, is an indoor air pollutant in many homes, despite widespread knowledge about the harmful effects of
   <xref articleid="68323">
    smoking
   </xref>
   . Secondhand smoke contains many carcinogenic compounds as well as strong irritants. In some geographic regions, naturally occurring
   <xref articleid="62436">
    radon
   </xref>
   , a radioactive gas, can seep from the ground into buildings and accumulate to harmful levels. Exposure to all indoor air pollutants can be reduced by appropriate building construction and maintenance methods, limitations on pollutant sources, and provision of adequate ventilation.
