   blending
  </e>
  , in yarn production, process of combining fibres of different origins, length, thickness, or colour to make yarn. Blending is accomplished before spinning and is performed to impart such desirable characteristics as strength or durability, to reduce cost by combining expensive fibres with less costly types, or to achieve special colour or texture effects. Fabrics made from such fibres are called blends. Blending also refers to the process of combining small amounts of the same fibre taken from different lots to achieve a uniform result.
