  soil usually forming in a broadleaf forest and characterized by moderate leaching, which produces an accumulation of clay and, to some degree, iron that have been transported (eluviated) from another area by water. The humus formed produces a textural horizon (layer) that is less than 50 cm (20 inches) from the surface. Podzolic soils may have laterite (a soil layer cemented together by iron) in place of the humic horizon or along with it. A podzolic soil may be distinguished from a

  ) because the main effect of the humic acid in podzolic soils is clay eluviation, whereas in podzols it is iron eluviation or the leaching of all weathering products, or both, which leaves a bleached, ashy horizon.
