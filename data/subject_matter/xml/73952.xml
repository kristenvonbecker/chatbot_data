  either of two young who are simultaneously born from one mother. Twinning, common in many animals, is of two biological kinds: the one-egg (monozygotic), or identical, type and the two-egg (dizygotic), or fraternal, type. The latter type is more usual and can be thought of simply as a litter of two. In humans, psychological studies of sets of identical twins, since they are genetically identical, have provided much otherwise unobtainable information on the relative effects of genetic endowment and environment.
