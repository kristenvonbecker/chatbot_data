  , liquefaction of a solid accompanied by decomposition or by reaction with the melt to produce another solid and a liquid that differs in composition from the original solid. For example, enstatite, a magnesium silicate (MgSiO
  <sub>
   3
  </sub>
  ), melts incongruently at low pressures to form forsterite, which is another magnesium silicate (Mg
  <sub>
   2
  </sub>
  SiO
  <sub>
   4
  </sub>
  ), and a liquid enriched in silica (SiO
  <sub>
   2
  </sub>
  ). At pressures between 2.5 and 5.5 kilobars, the melting of enstatite is congruent.
