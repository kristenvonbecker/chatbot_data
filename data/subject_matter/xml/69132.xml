  -bar (ℏ), equal to the Planck constant divided by 2π. For electrons, neutrons, and protons, the multiple is 0.5; pions have zero spin. The total angular momentum of nuclei more complex than the proton is the vector sum of the orbital angular momenta and intrinsic spins of the constituent nucleons. For nuclei of even mass number, the multiple is an integer; for those of odd mass number, the multiple is a half-integer. All nuclei with even numbers of neutrons and protons have spin zero in their ground states.
