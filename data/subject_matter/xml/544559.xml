  According to
  <xref articleid="55622">
   Newton’s first law
  </xref>
  (also known as the principle of
  <xref articleid="42378">
   inertia
  </xref>
  ), a body with no net force acting on it will either remain at rest or continue to move with uniform speed in a straight line, according to its initial condition of motion. In fact, in classical Newtonian
  <xref articleid="110307">
   mechanics
  </xref>
  , there is no important distinction between rest and uniform motion in a straight line; they may be regarded as the same state of motion seen by different observers, one moving at the same velocity as the particle, the other moving at constant velocity with respect to the particle.

  A body in motion may be said to have

   momentum
  </xref>
  equal to the product of its mass and its velocity. It also has a kind of energy that is entirely due to its motion, called kinetic energy. The
