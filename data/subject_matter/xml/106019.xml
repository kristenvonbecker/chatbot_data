   Electrostatics
  </title>
  <p>
   Electrostatics is the study of electromagnetic phenomena that occur when there are no moving charges—i.e., after a static equilibrium has been established. Charges reach their equilibrium positions rapidly because the electric force is extremely strong. The mathematical methods of electrostatics make it possible to calculate the distributions of the
   <xref articleid="32278">

   </xref>
   and of the

    conductors
   </xref>
   , and
   <xref articleid="42511">
    insulators
   </xref>
   . Conversely, given a set of conductors with known potentials, it is possible to calculate electric fields in regions between the conductors and to determine the charge distribution on the surface of the conductors. The electric energy of a set of charges at rest can be viewed from the standpoint of the
   <xref articleid="77472">

   required to assemble the charges; alternatively, the energy also can be considered to reside in the electric field produced by this assembly of charges. Finally, energy can be stored in a

   </xref>
   ; the energy required to charge such a device is stored in it as electrostatic energy of the electric field.

    Static electricity is a familiar electric phenomenon in which charged particles are transferred from one body to another. For example, if two objects are rubbed together, especially if the objects are insulators and the surrounding air is dry, the objects acquire equal and opposite charges and an attractive force develops between them. The object that loses
    <xref articleid="32316">

    </xref>
    becomes positively charged, and the other becomes negatively charged. The force is simply the attraction between charges of opposite sign. The properties of this force were described above; they are incorporated in the mathematical relationship known as

     The electric field is related to the variation of the electric potential in space. The potential provides a convenient tool for solving a wide variety of problems in electrostatics. In a region of space where the potential varies, a charge is subjected to an electric force. For a positive charge the direction of this force is opposite the gradient of the potential—that is to say, in the direction in which the potential decreases the most rapidly. A negative charge would be subjected to a force in the direction of the most rapid increase of the potential. In both instances, the magnitude of the force is proportional to the rate of change of the potential in the indicated directions. If the potential in a region of space is constant, there is no force on either positive or negative charge. In a 12-volt car
     <xref articleid="106044">
      battery
     </xref>
     , positive charges would tend to move away from the positive terminal and toward the negative terminal, while negative charges would tend to move in the opposite direction—i.e., from the negative to the positive terminal. The latter occurs when a

In a situation of static equilibrium, excess charges are located on the surface of conductors. Because there are no electric fields inside the conducting material, all parts of a given conductor are at the same potential; hence, a conductor is an equipotential in a static situation.

In carrying out the numerical solution of the electrostatic problem in the figure, the electrostatic potential was determined directly by means of one of its important properties: in a region where there is no charge (in this case, between the conductors), the value of the potential at a given point is the average of the values of the potential in the neighbourhood of the point. This follows from the fact that the electrostatic potential in a charge-free region obeys

     replaces the potential at each coordinate point that is not on a conductor by the average of the values of the potential around that point; it scans the entire set of points many times until the values of the potentials differ by an amount small enough to indicate a satisfactory solution. Clearly, the larger the number of points, the more accurate the solution will be. The computation time as well as the computer memory size requirement increase rapidly, however, especially in three-dimensional problems with complex geometry.

The lines in the figure represent equipotential surfaces. The distance between two equipotential surfaces tells how rapidly the potential changes, with the smallest distances corresponding to the location of the greatest rate of change and thus to the largest values of the electric field. Looking at the +20-volt and +15-volt equipotential surfaces, one observes immediately that they are closest to each other at the sharp external corners of the right-angle conductor. This shows that the strongest electric fields on the surface of a charged conductor are found on the sharpest external parts of the conductor; electrical breakdowns are most likely to occur there. It also should be noted that the electric field is weakest in the inside corners, both on the inside corner of the right-angle piece and on the inside corners of the square enclosure.

Again, it can be seen that the field is strongest on outside corners of the charged L-shaped conductor; the largest surface charge density must occur at those locations. The field is weakest in the inside corners. The signs of the charges on the conducting surfaces can be deduced from the fact that electric fields point away from positive charges and toward negative charges.

     Principle of the capacitor
    </title>
    <p>
     To understand how a charged capacitor stores energy, consider the following charging process. With both plates of the capacitor initially uncharged, a small amount of negative charge is removed from the lower plate and placed on the upper plate. Thus, little
     <xref articleid="77472">
      work
     </xref>
     is required to make the lower plate slightly positive and the upper plate slightly negative. As the process is repeated, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to transport the same amount of negative charge, since the charge is being moved toward a plate that is already negatively charged and away from a plate that is positively charged. The negative charge on the upper plate repels the negative charge moving toward it, and the positive charge on the lower plate exerts an attractive force on the negative charge being moved away. Therefore, work has to be done to charge the capacitor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where and how is this energy stored? The negative charges on the upper plate are attracted toward the positive charges on the lower plate and could do work if they could leave the plate. Because they cannot leave the plate, however, the energy is stored. A mechanical analogy is the potential energy of a stretched spring. Another way to understand the energy stored in a capacitor is to compare an uncharged capacitor with a charged capacitor. In the uncharged capacitor, there is no electric field between the plates; in the charged capacitor, because of the positive and negative charges on the inside surfaces of the plates, there is an electric field between the plates with the field lines pointing from the positively charged plate to the negatively charged one. The energy stored is the energy that was required to establish the field. In the simple geometry of
     <assemblyref assemblyid="a1330">
      Figure 11
     </assemblyref>
     , it is apparent that there is a nearly uniform electric field between the plates; the field becomes more uniform as the distance between the plates decreases and the area of the plates increases. It was explained above how the magnitude of the electric field can be obtained from the electric potential. In summary, the electric field is the change in the potential across a small distance in a direction perpendicular to an equipotential surface divided by that small distance. In
     <assemblyref assemblyid="a1330">

     Dielectrics, polarization, and electric dipole moment
    </title>
    <p>
     The amount of charge stored in a capacitor is the product of the voltage and the capacity. What limits the amount of charge that can be stored on a capacitor? The voltage can be increased, but electric breakdown will occur if the electric field inside the capacitor becomes too large. The capacity can be increased by expanding the electrode areas and by reducing the gap between the electrodes. In general, capacitors that can withstand high voltages have a relatively small capacity. If only low voltages are needed, however, compact capacitors with rather large capacities can be manufactured. One method for increasing capacity is to insert between the conductors an insulating material that reduces the voltage because of its effect on the electric field. Such materials are called
     <xref articleid="30382">
      dielectrics
     </xref>
     (substances with no free charges). When the molecules of a dielectric are placed in the electric field, their negatively charged

     separate slightly from their positively charged cores. With this separation, referred to as polarization, the

     Is there an electric force between a charged object and uncharged matter, such as a piece of wood? Surprisingly, the answer is yes, and the force is attractive. The reason is that under the influence of the electric field of a charged object, the negatively charged electrons and positively charged nuclei within the
     <xref articleid="110411">
      atoms
     </xref>
     and molecules are subjected to forces in opposite directions. As a result, the negative and positive charges separate slightly. Such atoms and molecules are said to be polarized and to have an electric dipole moment. The molecules in the wood acquire an electric dipole moment in the direction of the external electric field. The polarized molecules are attracted toward the charged object because the field increases in the direction of the charged object.

Even small-sized capacitors can store enormous amounts of charge. Modern techniques and dielectric materials permit the manufacture of capacitors that occupy less than one cubic centimetre and yet store 10

As current flows from the positively charged conductor to the negatively charged one, the charges on both conductors decrease with time, as does the potential difference between the conductors. The current therefore also decreases with time and eventually ceases when the conductors are discharged.

    In an electric circuit under steady-state conditions, the flow of charge does not change with time and the charge distribution stays the same. Since charge flows from one location to another, there must be some mechanism to keep the charge distribution constant. In turn, the values of the

     Electrons

    in an
    <xref articleid="110411">
     atom
    </xref>
    can have only certain well-defined energies, and, depending on their energies, the electrons are said to occupy particular energy levels. In a typical atom with many electrons, the lower energy levels are filled, each with the number of electrons allowed by a
    <xref articleid="110312">
     quantum mechanical
    </xref>
    rule known as the
    <xref articleid="58783">
     Pauli exclusion principle
    </xref>
    . Depending on the element, the highest energy level to have electrons may or may not be completely full. If two atoms of some element are brought close enough together so that they interact, the two-atom system has two closely spaced levels for each level of the single atom. If 10 atoms interact, the 10-atom system will have a cluster of 10 levels corresponding to each single level of an individual atom. In a
    <xref articleid="68592">
     solid
    </xref>
    , the number of atoms and hence the number of levels is extremely large; most of the higher energy levels overlap in a continuous fashion except for certain energies in which there are no levels at all. Energy regions with levels are called energy bands, and regions that have no levels are referred to as
    <xref articleid="627807">
     band gaps
    </xref>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The highest energy band occupied by electrons is the valence band. In a conductor, the valence band is partially filled, and since there are numerous empty levels, the electrons are free to move under the influence of an
    <xref articleid="32278">
     electric field
    </xref>
    ; thus, in a metal the valence band is also the conduction band. In an insulator, electrons completely fill the valence band; and the gap between it and the next band, which is the conduction band, is large. The electrons cannot move under the influence of an electric field unless they are given enough energy to cross the large energy gap to the conduction band. In a semiconductor, the gap to the conduction band is smaller than in an insulator. At room temperature, the valence band is almost completely filled. A few electrons are missing from the valence band because they have acquired enough thermal energy to cross the band gap to the conduction band; as a result, they can move under the influence of an external electric field. The “holes” left behind in the valence band are mobile charge carriers but behave like positive charge carriers.
   </p>
   <p>
    For many materials, including metals, resistance to the flow of charge tends to increase with
    <xref articleid="71632">
     temperature
    </xref>
    . For example, an increase of 5° C (9° F) increases the resistivity of
    <xref articleid="26194">
     copper
    </xref>
    by 2 percent. In contrast, the resistivity of insulators and especially of semiconductors such as
    <xref articleid="67764">
     silicon
    </xref>
    and
    <xref articleid="36582">
     germanium
    </xref>
    decreases rapidly with temperature; the increased thermal energy causes some of the electrons to populate levels in the conduction band where, influenced by an external electric field, they are free to move. The energy difference between the valence levels and the conduction band has a strong influence on the conductivity of these materials, with a smaller gap resulting in higher conduction at lower temperatures.
   </p>
   <p>
    The values of electric resistivities listed in show an extremely large variation in the capability of different materials to conduct electricity. The principal reason for the large variation is the wide range in the availability and mobility of charge carriers within the materials. The copper wire in
    <assemblyref assemblyid="a1331">
     Figure 12
    </assemblyref>
    , for example, has many extremely mobile carriers; each copper atom has approximately one free electron, which is highly mobile because of its small mass. An

    </xref>
    , such as a saltwater
    <xref articleid="68634">

    In certain materials, however, the power dissipation that manifests itself as heat suddenly disappears if the conductor is cooled to a very low temperature. The disappearance of all resistance is a phenomenon known as
    <xref articleid="70388">
     superconductivity
    </xref>
    . As mentioned earlier, electrons acquire some average drift velocity
    <e type="italic">
     v
    </e>
    under the influence of an electric field in a wire. Normally the electrons, subjected to a force because of an electric field, accelerate and progressively acquire greater speed. Their velocity is, however, limited in a wire because they lose some of their acquired energy to the wire in collisions with other electrons and in collisions with atoms in the wire. The lost energy is either transferred to other electrons, which later radiate, or the wire becomes excited with tiny mechanical vibrations referred to as
    <xref articleid="59769">
     phonons
    </xref>
    . Both processes heat the material. The term phonon emphasizes the relationship of these vibrations to another mechanical vibration—namely,
    <xref articleid="109557">
     sound
    </xref>
    . In a superconductor, a complex quantum mechanical effect prevents these small losses of energy to the medium. The effect involves interactions between electrons and also those between electrons and the rest of the material. It can be visualized by considering the coupling of the electrons in pairs with opposite momenta; the motion of the paired electrons is such that no energy is given up to the medium in inelastic collisions or phonon excitations. One can imagine that an electron about to “collide” with and lose energy to the medium could end up instead colliding with its partner so that they exchange momentum without imparting any to the medium.

    can deliver current to a circuit such as that of a car radio for a considerable length of time, during which the potential difference between the terminals of the battery remains close to 12 volts. The battery must have a means of continuously replenishing the excess positive and negative charges that are located on the respective terminals and that are responsible for the 12-volt potential difference between the terminals. The charges must be transported from one terminal to the other in a direction opposite to the electric force on the charges between the terminals. Any device that accomplishes this transport of charge constitutes a source of electromotive force. A car battery, for example, uses chemical reactions to generate

    . Because it is conceptually simpler than a chemical source of electromotive force, the Van de Graaff generator will be discussed first.

    An insulating conveyor belt carries positive charge from the base of the Van de Graaff machine to the inside of a large conducting dome. The charge is removed from the belt by the proximity of sharp metal
    <xref articleid="32299">
     electrodes
    </xref>
    called charge remover points. The charge then moves rapidly to the outside of the conducting dome. The positively charged dome creates an electric field, which points away from the dome and provides a repelling action on additional positive charges transported on the belt toward the dome. Thus, work is done to keep the conveyor belt turning. If a current is allowed to flow from the dome to ground and if an equal current is provided by the transport of charge on the insulating belt, equilibrium is established and the potential of the dome remains at a constant positive value. In this example, the current from the dome to ground consists of a stream of positive ions inside the accelerating tube, moving in the direction of the electric field. The motion of the charge on the belt is in a direction opposite to the force that the electric field of the dome exerts on the charge. This motion of charge in a direction opposite the electric field is a feature common to all sources of electromotive force.

    </xref>
    make up a simple voltaic cell. The potential difference between the copper and the zinc wires can be measured easily and is found to be 1.1 volts; the copper wire acts as the positive terminal. Such a “lemon battery” is a rather poor voltaic cell capable of supplying only small amounts of electric power. Another kind of 1.1-volt battery constructed with essentially the same materials can provide much more electricity. In this case, a copper wire is placed in a solution of copper sulfate and a zinc wire in a solution of zinc sulfate; the two solutions are connected electrically by a potassium chloride salt bridge. (A salt bridge is a conductor with ions as charge carriers.) In both kinds of batteries, the energy comes from the difference in the degree of binding between the electrons in copper and those in zinc. Energy is gained when copper ions from the copper sulfate solution are deposited on the copper electrode as neutral copper ions, thus removing free electrons from the copper wire. At the same time, zinc atoms from the zinc wire go into solution as positively charged zinc ions, leaving the zinc wire with excess free electrons. The result is a positively charged copper wire and a negatively charged zinc wire. The two reactions are separated physically, with the salt bridge completing the internal circuit.

    This relationship follows directly from the definition of resistance in equation (

    are imagined to be wires of the same length and material, they would be wires with different cross-sectional areas. Connecting them in parallel is equivalent to placing them side by side, increasing the total area available for the flow of charge. Clearly, the equivalent resistance is smaller than the resistance of either resistor individually. As a numerical example, for

    = 0. If this last equation seems puzzling because all the currents appear to flow in and none flows out, it is because of the choice of directions for the individual currents. In solving a problem, the direction chosen for the currents is arbitrary. Once the problem has been solved, some currents have a positive value, and the direction arbitrarily chosen is the one of the actual current. In the solution some currents may have a negative value, in which case the actual current flows in a direction opposite that of the arbitrary initial choice.

    Kirchhoff’s second law is as follows: the sum of electromotive forces in a loop equals the sum of potential drops in the loop. When electromotive forces in a circuit are symbolized as circuit components as in
    <assemblyref assemblyid="a1334">
     Figure 15
    </assemblyref>
    , this law can be stated quite simply: the sum of the potential differences across all the components in a closed loop equals zero. To illustrate and clarify this relation, one can consider a single circuit with two sources of electromotive forces

    <xref articleid="471073">
     capacitors

     magnetic field
    </xref>
    generated by the current in the coil. All three components provide some impedance to the flow of alternating currents. In the case of capacitors and inductors, the impedance depends on the frequency of the current. With resistors, impedance is independent of frequency and is simply the resistance. This is easily seen from

    <e type="italic">
     b

    . This decrease in the potential of a transient explains the “guardian role” that capacitors play in protecting delicate and complex electronic circuits from damage by large transient voltages. These transients, which generally occur at high frequency, produce effects similar to those produced by pulses of short duration. They can damage equipment when they induce circuit components to break down electrically. Transient voltages are often introduced into electronic circuits through power supplies. A concise way to describe the role of the capacitor in the above example is to say that its impedance to an electric signal decreases with increasing frequency. In the example, much of the signal is shunted to ground instead of appearing at point

    A sinusoidal electromotive force can be generated using the principles described in Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction (

    <xref articleid="106021" refid="h71591">
     electromagnetism: Faraday’s law of induction
    </xref>
    ). Briefly, an alternating electromotive force can be induced in a loop of conducting wire by rotating the loop of wire in a uniform magnetic field.
   </p>
   <p>
    In AC circuits, it is often necessary to find the currents as a function of time in the various parts of the circuit for a given source of sinusoidal electromotive force. While the problems can become quite complex, the solutions are based on Kirchhoff’s two laws discussed above (
    <e type="italic">

    </e>
    <xref articleid="106019" refid="h71568">

    ). The solution for the current in a given loop takes the form

     i

    =

    − ϕ). The current has the same frequency as the applied voltage but is not necessarily “in phase” with that voltage. When the phase angle ϕ does not equal zero, the maximum of the current does not occur when the driving voltage is at its maximum.

For this single-loop problem, only the second of Kirchhoff’s laws is needed since there is only one current. The circuit is shown in

The most important solution describes the current and voltages after transient effects have been dampened; the transient effects last only a short time after the circuit is completed.

     The maximum amplitude of the voltage across the inductor, 300 volts, is much greater than the 50-volt amplitude of the driving sinusoidal electromotive force. This result is typical of resonance phenomena. In a familiar mechanical system, children on swings time their kicks to attain very large swings (much larger than they could attain with a single kick). In a more spectacular, albeit costly, example, the collapse of the

     (a suspension bridge across the Narrows of Puget Sound, Washington) on November 7, 1940, was the result of the large amplitudes of oscillations that the span attained as it was driven in resonance by high winds. A ubiquitous example of electric resonance occurs when a

    In practice, the converse piezoelectric effect, which occurs when an external electric field changes the dimensions of a crystal, is small because the electric fields that can be generated in a laboratory are minuscule compared to those existing naturally in matter. A static electric field of 10
    <sup>
     6
    </sup>

    Thermionic emission

   <p>
    A metal contains mobile electrons in a partially filled band of energy levels—i.e., the conduction band. These electrons, though mobile within the metal, are rather tightly bound to it. The energy that is required to release a mobile electron from the metal varies from about 1.5 to 6

    </xref>
    , some of the electrons acquire enough energy from thermal collisions to escape from the metal. The number of electrons emitted and therefore the thermionic emission current depend critically on temperature.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a metal the conduction-band levels are filled up to the Fermi level, which lies at an energy −
    <e type="italic">
     W
    </e>
    relative to a free electron outside the metal. The work function of the metal, which is the energy required to remove an electron from the metal, is therefore equal to
    <e type="italic">
     W
    </e>
    . At a temperature of 1,000 K only a small fraction of the mobile electrons have sufficient energy to escape. The electrons that can escape are moving so fast in the metal and have such high kinetic energies that they are unaffected by the periodic potential caused by atoms of the metallic lattice. They behave like electrons trapped in a region of constant potential. Because of this, when the rate at which electrons escape from the metal is calculated, the detailed structure of the metal has little influence on the final result. A formula known as Richardson’s law (first proposed by the English physicist Owen W. Richardson) is roughly valid for all metals. It is usually expressed in terms of the emission current density (

    Secondary electron emission
   </title>
   <p>
    If electrons with energies of 10 to 1,000 electron volts strike a metal surface in a vacuum, their energy is lost in collisions in a region near the surface, and most of it is transferred to other electrons in the metal. Because this occurs near the surface, some of these electrons may be ejected from the metal and form a secondary emission current. The ratio of secondary
    <xref articleid="32316">
     electrons
    </xref>
    to incident electrons is known as the secondary emission coefficient. For low-incident energies (below about one electron volt), the primary electrons tend to be reflected and the secondary emission coefficient is near unity. With increasing energy, the coefficient at first falls and then at about 10 electron volts begins to rise again, usually reaching a peak of value between 2 and 4 at energies of a few hundred electron volts. At higher energies, the primary electrons penetrate so far below the surface before losing energy that the excited electrons have little chance of reaching the surface and escaping. The secondary emission coefficients fall and, when the electrons have energies exceeding 20 kiloelectron volts, are usually well below unity. Secondary emission also can occur in
    <xref articleid="42511">

Visible radiation produces electron transitions with almost unity quantum efficiency in silicon. Each transition yields a hole–electron pair (i.e., two carriers) that contributes to electric conductivity. For example, if one milliwatt of light strikes a sample of pure silicon in the form of a thin plate one square centimetre in area and 0.03 centimetre thick (which is thick enough to absorb all incident light), the resistance of the plate will be decreased by a factor of about 1,000. In practice, photoconductive effects are not usually as large as this, but this example indicates that appreciable changes in conductivity can occur even with low illumination. Photoconductive devices are simple to construct and are used to detect visible, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation.

    Conduction electrons moving in a solid under the influence of an electric field usually lose kinetic energy in low-energy collisions as fast as they acquire it from the field. Under certain circumstances in semiconductors, however, they can acquire enough energy between collisions to excite atoms in the next collision and produce radiation as the atoms de-excite. A voltage applied across a thin layer of zinc sulfide powder causes just such an electroluminescent effect. Electroluminescent panels are of more interest as signal indicators and display devices than as a source of general illumination.

    phosphide and of gallium indium arsenide phosphide have proved more useful. Unlike gas or optically pumped lasers, these semiconductor lasers can be modulated directly at high frequencies. They are used not only in devices such as

    Electric activity in living tissue is a cellular phenomenon, dependent on the cell membrane. The membrane acts like a
    <xref articleid="471073">
     capacitor
    </xref>
    , storing energy as electrically charged
    <xref articleid="42688">
     ions
    </xref>
    on opposite sides of the membrane. The stored energy is available for rapid utilization and stabilizes the membrane system so that it is not activated by small disturbances.

    <xref articleid="106125">
     Cells
    </xref>
    capable of electric activity show a resting potential in which their interiors are negative by about 0.1 volt or less compared with the outside of the cell. When the cell is activated, the resting potential may reverse suddenly in sign; as a result, the outside of the cell becomes negative and the inside positive. This condition lasts for a short time, after which the cell returns to its original resting state. This sequence, called depolarization and repolarization, is accompanied by a flow of substantial current through the active cell membrane, so that a “dipole-current source” exists for a short period. Small currents flow from this source through the aqueous medium containing the cell and are detectable at considerable distances from it. These currents, originating in active membrane, are functionally significant very close to their site of origin but must be considered incidental at any distance from it. In
    <xref articleid="32270">
     electric fish
    </xref>
    , however, adaptations have occurred, and this otherwise incidental electric current is actually utilized. In some species the external current is apparently used for sensing purposes, while in others it is used to stun or kill prey. In both cases, voltages from many cells add up in series, thus assuring that the specialized functions can be performed. Bioelectric potentials detected at some distance from the cells generating them may be as small as the 20 or 30 microvolts associated with certain components of the human

    can deliver electric shocks with voltages as large as 1,000 volts.

    In addition to the potentials originating in nerve or muscle cells, relatively steady or slowly varying potentials (often designated dc) are known. These dc potentials occur in the following cases: in areas where cells have been damaged and where ionized potassium is leaking (as much as 50 millivolts); when one part of the
    <xref articleid="16178">
     brain
    </xref>
    is compared with another part (up to one millivolt); when different areas of the
    <xref articleid="106316">
     skin
    </xref>
    are compared (up to 10 millivolts); within pockets in active glands, e.g., follicles in the
    <xref articleid="72364">
     thyroid
    </xref>
    (as high as 60 millivolts); and in special structures in the inner ear (about 80 millivolts).
   </p>
   <p>
    A small electric shock caused by static electricity during cold, dry weather is a familiar experience. While the sudden muscular reaction it engenders is sometimes unpleasant, it is usually harmless. Even though static potentials of several thousand volts are involved, a current exists for only a brief time and the total charge is very small. A steady current of two milliamperes through the body is barely noticeable. Severe electrical shock can occur above 10 milliamperes, however. Lethal current levels range from 100 to 200 milliamperes. Larger currents, which produce burns and unconsciousness, are not fatal if the victim is given prompt medical care. (Above 200 milliamperes, the heart is clamped during the shock and does not undergo ventricular fibrillation.) Prevention clearly includes avoiding contact with live electric wiring; risk of injury increases considerably if the skin is wet, as the electric resistance of wet skin may be hundreds of times smaller than that of dry skin.
