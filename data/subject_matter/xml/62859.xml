  Reading was a Danish encampment as early as 871. Between the 12th and 16th centuries Reading was dominated by a struggle for privileges between the abbey and the emergent merchants’ guild. The town suffered severely in the
  <xref articleid="32663">
   English Civil Wars
  </xref>
  of the mid-17th century. By the 17th century the town’s trade, notably in clothing, had begun to decline. In the 18th century the chief trade was in malt.

  , who turned it into a palace, but then it was destroyed during the English Civil Wars. A tablet in the chapter house notes that the famous medieval round “Sumer is icumen in” was written by a monk there about 1240. A memorial stone marks the grave of Henry I (died 1135).
