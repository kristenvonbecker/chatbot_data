   inertia
  </e>
  , property of a body by virtue of which it opposes any agency that attempts to put it in motion or, if it is moving, to change the magnitude or direction of its velocity. Inertia is a passive property and does not enable a body to do anything except oppose such active agents as forces and torques. A moving body keeps moving not because of its inertia but only because of the absence of a force to slow it down, change its course, or speed it up.

  There are two numerical measures of the inertia of a body: its mass, which governs its resistance to the action of a force, and its

  about a specified axis, which measures its resistance to the action of a torque about the same axis.
