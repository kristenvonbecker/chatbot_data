   mean free path

  , average distance an object will move between collisions. The actual distance a particle, such as a molecule in a gas, will move before a collision, called free path, cannot generally be given because its calculation would require knowledge of the path of every particle in the region. The probability (

   dP

  ) that a molecule will move a distance between two points (
  <e type="italic">
   x
  </e>
  and
  <e type="italic">
   x
  </e>
  +
  <e type="italic">
   dx
  </e>
  ) without collision is proportional to an exponential factor; that is,

  is the mean free path and is the average (mean) distance traveled by a molecule between collisions. The mean free path of an oxygen gas molecule under a pressure of 1 atmosphere at 0° C is about 6 × 10
