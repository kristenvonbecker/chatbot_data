  , in wave motion, any phenomenon associated with the propagation of individual waves at speeds that depend on their wavelengths. Ocean waves, for example, move at speeds proportional to the square root of their wavelengths; these speeds vary from a few feet per second for ripples to hundreds of miles per hour for tsunamis. A wave of light has a speed in a transparent medium that varies inversely with the index of refraction (a measure of the angle by which the direction of a wave is changed as it moves from one medium into another). Any transparent medium—
