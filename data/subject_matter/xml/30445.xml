  dilemma
 </title>
 <p>
  <e type="bold">
   dilemma
  </e>
  , in syllogistic, or traditional, logic, any one of several forms of inference in which there are two major premises of hypothetical form and a disjunctive (“either . . . or”) minor premise. For example:
 </p>
 <p>
  If we increase the price, sales will slump.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we decrease the quality, sales will slump.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either we increase the price or
 </p>
 <p>
  we decrease the quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, sales will slump.
 </p>
 <p>
  In logic ⊃ signifies “if . . . then”; ∨ signifies “either . . . or”. Symbolically, therefore, a dilemma is an argument of the form
  <e type="italic">
   A
  </e>
  ⊃
  <e type="italic">
   C, B
  </e>
  ⊃
  <e type="italic">
   C, A
  </e>
  ∨
  <e type="italic">
   B,
  </e>
  therefore
  <e type="italic">
   C
  </e>
  .
 </p>

  It is not necessary that a dilemma should have an unwelcome conclusion; but from its use in rhetoric the word has come to mean a situation in which each of the alternative courses of action (presented as the only ones open) leads to some unsatisfactory consequence. To take a familiar example, a person who is asked, “Have you stopped beating your wife?” is presented with a rhetorical dilemma. In this more complicated version of the dilemma, however, two unwelcome results are presented instead of one (
  <e type="italic">
   C,
  </e>
  above). Thus, the conclusion itself becomes a disjunction:
 </p>
 <p>
  Either you have been beating your wife or you are continuing to beat her.
