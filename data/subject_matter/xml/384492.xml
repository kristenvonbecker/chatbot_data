  , any of about 35 species of
  <xref articleid="110254">
   lizards
  </xref>
  constituting two genera (
  <e type="italic">
   Ablepharus
  </e>
  and
  <e type="italic">
   Cryptoblepharus
  </e>
  ) in the family Scincidae. Snake-eyed
  <xref articleid="68113">
   skinks

  lack
  <xref articleid="33485">
   eyelids
  </xref>
  and have transparent
  <xref articleid="66008">
   scales
  </xref>
  (spectacles) covering the eyes similar to those of
  <xref articleid="110255">
   snakes
  </xref>
  . Although the function of the spectacle remains unknown, it likely reduces water loss by
  <xref articleid="74826">
   evaporation
  </xref>
  from the head region. Spectacles in these two skink genera evolved independently and thus represent an example of
  <xref articleid="106075" refid="h49899">
   convergent evolution
  </xref>
  . The spectacle is derived from the lower eyelid, which is fused to scales above the eye.

  Members of the genus
  <e type="italic">
   Ablepharus
  </e>
  , often referred to as ocellated skinks, range from southeastern Europe to Pakistan. They have elongate bodies, long tails, and small limbs. They live within
  <xref articleid="47499">
   leaf
  </xref>
  litter or under rocks, twigs, or low vegetation. Members of the genus
  <e type="italic">
   Cryptoblepharus
  </e>
  are slender with long tails but with well-developed limbs. They occur in southeast Africa, Australia, the Indo-Pacific Islands and have been introduced to so many places that they may have the widest geographic distribution of any lizard genus.
