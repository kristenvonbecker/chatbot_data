  , principal American base in Antarctica, lying on the northeastern edge of Ross Ice Shelf near Kainan Bay. First set up in 1928 as the headquarters for the polar explorations of Richard E. Byrd, it was reused and enlarged by Byrd on his return expedition in 1933–35. In 1940 Byrd established a camp 7 miles (11 km) northeast, later named Little America III, that served as the western base for a government-sponsored exploration of Marie Byrd Land before World War II. After the war Little America IV, consisting of an airstrip and 60 tents, was set up nearby as a headquarters for Operation High Jump (1946–47), an expedition designed to explore and document Antarctica’s coastline as well as to extend U.S. sovereignty to the continent.

  When an expedition next returned (1956) in preparation for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58), parts of the earlier Little America camps were found to have vanished because of calving of the ice shelf. Consequently, Little America V was set up several miles northeast, near Kainan Bay, to serve as a supply base and terminus of a 630-mile- (1,014-kilometre-) long “highway” to Byrd Station in the continent’s interior.
