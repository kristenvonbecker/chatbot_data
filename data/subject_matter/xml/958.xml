  (also the energy released in the reverse process). Lattice energy is usually measured in kilojoules per mole (1 mole = 6.0221367 ¥ 10

  ). For each particular solid, the lattice energy is a constant that measures how tightly the constituent particles are held together. The lattice energy can be calculated if the arrangement and spacing of the particles are known. Typical values for lattice energies of ionic solids at room temperature are roughly 700 to 1,000 kilojoules per mole.
