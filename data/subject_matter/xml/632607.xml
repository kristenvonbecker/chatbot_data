  of living things in response to the
  <xref articleid="29953">
   density

  of the population (the number of individuals per unit area). Density-dependent factors often arise from biological phenomena, rather than from physical and chemical phenomena. Density-dependent factors are sometimes called regulating factors because of their potential for maintaining population density within a narrow range of values.

  For example, some

  spread faster in populations where individuals live in close proximity with one another than in those whose individuals live farther apart. Similarly, competition for
  <xref articleid="34792">
   food
  </xref>
  and other resources rises with density and affects an increasing proportion of the population. However, as density decreases, such as through mortality or migration, the influence of density-dependent factors also decreases. For example, disease transmission may decline as individuals perish and surviving members of a population come into contact with one another less frequently. Likewise, competition for food and

  The dynamics of most populations of living things are influenced by a combination of density-dependent factors and
  <xref articleid="632550">

  </xref>
  (that is, those that affect the population regardless of how concentrated its members are), and the relative effects of the factors vary among populations.
