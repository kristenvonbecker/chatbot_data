  , (born Oct. 8, 1713, Fairnilee, Selkirkshire, Scot.—died Nov. 22, 1794, Edinburgh), Scottish author who wrote the original version of the popular ballad “Flowers of the Forest.” Her lyrics beginning “I’ve seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling,” set to the old air of “Flowers of the Forest,” were probably written before 1731, although they were not published until 1765. They were occasioned by the failure of seven Selkirkshire lairds in their financial speculations. After her marriage to Patrick Cockburn of Ormiston, Scot., she became famous for her wit and brilliance as a hostess. She gathered around her a circle of literary and political celebrities that included Sir Walter Scott.
