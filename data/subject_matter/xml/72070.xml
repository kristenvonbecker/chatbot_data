  The structure of a liquid is always less ordered than that of the crystalline solid and, therefore, the liquid commonly occupies a larger volume. The behaviour of

  Melting of a given mass of a solid requires the addition of a characteristic amount of heat, the heat of fusion. In the reverse process, the freezing of the liquid to form the solid, the same quantity of heat must be removed. The heat of fusion of ice, the heat required to melt one gram, is about 80 calories; this amount of heat would raise the temperature of a gram of liquid water from the freezing point (0 °C, or 32 °F) to 80 °C (176 °F).
