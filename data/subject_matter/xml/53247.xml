    Several methods of representing a molecule’s structure. In Lewis structures, element symbols represent atoms, and dots represent electrons surrounding them. A pair of shared electrons (covalent bond) may also be shown as a single dash. The ball-and-stick model better illustrates the spatial arrangement of the atoms. For aromatic compounds, the Kekulé structure is common, in which each bond is represented by a dash, carbon atoms are implied where two or more lines meet, and hydrogen atoms are usually omitted. Bond-line formulas, similar to the Kekulé structure, are often used for complex nonaromatic organic compounds. Sugars are often drawn as Fischer projections, in which the carbon “backbone” is drawn as a straight vertical line, with carbon atoms implied where horizontal lines intersect the vertical one.

   The division of a sample of a substance into progressively smaller parts produces no change in either its composition or its chemical properties until parts consisting of single molecules are reached. Further subdivision of the substance leads to still smaller parts that usually differ from the original substance in composition and always differ from it in chemical properties. In this latter stage of fragmentation the

     A water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. A single oxygen atom contains six electrons in its outer shell, which can hold a total of eight electrons. When two hydrogen atoms are bound to an oxygen atom, the outer electron shell of oxygen is filled.

   Atoms consist of a single

    nucleus
   </xref>
   with a positive charge surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged
   <xref articleid="32316">
    electrons
   </xref>
   . When atoms approach one another closely, the electron clouds interact with each other and with the nuclei. If this interaction is such that the total energy of the system is lowered, then the atoms bond together to form a molecule. Thus, from a structural point of view, a molecule consists of an aggregation of atoms held together by valence forces. Diatomic molecules contain two atoms that are chemically bonded. If the two atoms are identical, as in, for example, the
   <xref articleid="57841">
    oxygen
   </xref>
   molecule (O
   <sub>

   </sub>
   ), they compose a homonuclear diatomic molecule, while if the atoms are different, as in the
   <xref articleid="20252">
    carbon monoxide
   </xref>
   molecule (CO), they make up a heteronuclear diatomic molecule. Molecules containing more than two atoms are termed polyatomic molecules, e.g.,

   The ratio of the numbers of atoms that can be bonded together to form molecules is fixed; for example, every water molecule contains two atoms of
   <xref articleid="110604">
    hydrogen
   </xref>
   and one atom of oxygen. It is this feature that distinguishes
   <xref articleid="110804">
    chemical compounds
   </xref>
   from solutions and other mechanical mixtures. Thus hydrogen and oxygen may be present in any arbitrary proportions in mechanical mixtures but when sparked will combine only in definite proportions to form the chemical compound water (H
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   O). It is possible for the same kinds of atoms to combine in different but definite proportions to form different molecules; for example, two atoms of hydrogen will chemically bond with one atom of oxygen to yield a water molecule, whereas two atoms of hydrogen can chemically bond with two atoms of oxygen to form a molecule of
   <xref articleid="41732">
    hydrogen peroxide
   </xref>
   (H
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   O
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   ). Furthermore, it is possible for atoms to bond together in identical proportions to form different molecules. Such molecules are called
   <xref articleid="42954">
    isomers
   </xref>
   and differ only in the arrangement of the atoms within the molecules. For example,

   ) both contain one, two, and six atoms of oxygen,

   Not all substances are made up of distinct molecular units. Sodium chloride (common table
   <xref articleid="111082">

   ), for example, consists of
   <xref articleid="68494">
    sodium

   <xref articleid="42688">
    ions
   </xref>
   and
   <xref articleid="82243">
    chlorine
   </xref>
   ions arranged in a lattice so that each sodium ion is surrounded by six equidistant chlorine ions and each chlorine ion is surrounded by six equidistant sodium ions. The forces acting between any sodium and any adjacent chlorine ion are equal. Hence, no distinct aggregate identifiable as a molecule of sodium chloride exists. Consequently, in sodium chloride and in all solids of similar type, the concept of the chemical molecule has no significance. Therefore, the formula for such a compound is given as the simplest ratio of the atoms, called a formula unit—in the case of sodium chloride, NaCl.

   Molecules are held together by shared electron pairs, or
   <xref articleid="26644">
    covalent bonds
   </xref>
   . Such bonds are directional, meaning that the atoms adopt specific positions relative to one another so as to maximize the bond strengths. As a result, each molecule has a definite, fairly rigid structure, or spatial distribution of its atoms. Structural chemistry is concerned with
   <xref articleid="74681">
    valence
   </xref>
   , which determines how atoms combine in definite ratios and how this is related to the bond directions and bond lengths. The properties of molecules correlate with their structures; for example, the water molecule is bent structurally and therefore has a dipole moment, whereas the carbon dioxide molecule is linear and has no dipole moment. The elucidation of the manner in which atoms are reorganized in the course of chemical reactions is important. In some molecules the structure may not be rigid; for example, in

   Polar and nonpolar molecules
  </title>
  <p>
   If a molecule has no net electrical charge, its negative charge is equal to its positive charge. The forces experienced by such molecules depend on how the positive and negative charges are arranged in space. If the arrangement is spherically symmetric, the molecule is said to be nonpolar. If there is an excess of positive charge on one end of the molecule and an excess of negative charge on the other, the molecule has a dipole moment (i.e., a measurable tendency to rotate in an electric or magnetic field) and is therefore called polar. When polar molecules are free to rotate, they tend to favour those orientations that lead to attractive forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nonpolar molecules generally are considered lipophilic (lipid-loving), whereas polar chemicals are hydrophilic (water-loving). Lipid-soluble, nonpolar molecules pass readily through a cell membrane because they dissolve in the hydrophobic, nonpolar portion of the lipid bilayer. Although permeable to water (a polar molecule), the nonpolar lipid bilayer of cell membranes is impermeable to many other polar molecules, such as charged ions or those that contain many polar side chains. Polar molecules pass through lipid membranes via specific transport systems.
