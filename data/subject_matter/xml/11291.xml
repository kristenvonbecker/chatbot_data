  , Aurora was the third most populous city in Colorado at the start of the 21st century. It was founded during the silver boom of 1891 and named Fletcher after its Canadian-born founder, Donald Fletcher, and it flourished as a mining centre until 1893, when a silver panic closed the mines. In 1902 Adams county was created from Arapahoe county, and the division line split the community, placing it in two counties; a portion of the present city also falls within Douglas county. Fletcher was renamed Aurora in 1907.

  The city is mainly residential but has some light manufactures (including fishing tackle and sporting goods, electronic equipment, luggage, and precision metal products). It also is the site of Buckley Air National Guard Base. In 1999 the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center was closed, and the area became the site of an immense redevelopment project. The decommissioned base was turned into a health and research park, featuring a branch campus of the University of Colorado. Denver International Airport lies to the northeast. On July 20, 2012, a heavily armed gunman opened fire in a crowded movie theatre in the city, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others before being arrested. Inc. 1891.
