  Cornstarch is high in carbohydrates but lacking in vitamins, protein, fibre, and minerals, making it one of the least nutritionally dense components of corn. Cornstarch absorbs moisture, however, making it useful as a thickener and anticaking agent in food products. It is used in certain oral medications, where it facilitates the disintegration of capsules and tablets. It may be used as a substitute for wheat flour in
