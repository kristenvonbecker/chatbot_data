  , any of a class of pigments composed of organic dyes that have been rendered insoluble by interaction with a compound of a metal. The interaction may involve the precipitation of a salt in which the proportions of dye to metal are fixed, or it may be a less well defined attraction between the dye and the surfaces of particles of the inorganic compound. Some lakes are prepared by a combination of both processes. Lakes considerably extend the range of colours available in the production of paints, cosmetics, and inks for printing and lithography.

  Dyes of several chemical classes are made into lakes by techniques that vary according to the nature of the salt-forming groups in the dye molecule. Mordant dyes and acid dyes form insoluble salts with metal ions, such as those of calcium and aluminum. Basic dyes contain amino groups and form insoluble salts with inorganic metal-containing acids such as phosphotungstic or phosphomolybdic acids.
