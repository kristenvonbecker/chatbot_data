   spinning
  </e>
  , in textiles, process of drawing out fibres from a mass and twisting them together to form a continuous thread or yarn. In man-made fibre production the name is applied to the extrusion of a solution to form a fibre, a process similar to the method by which silkworms and similar insect larvae produce filament to make their cocoons from a viscous fluid that they secrete.
