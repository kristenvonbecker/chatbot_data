   Novy Zhurnal

  (“The New Magazine”). Aldanov’s works and materials from his archives were published during the glasnost years in the six-volume

   Sobraniye sochineny
  </e>
  (1991–93; “Collected Works”). By the late 1990s, however, Aldanov’s popularity had diminished as the political significance of his work faded.
