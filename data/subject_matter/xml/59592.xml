  displays eight phases: new, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent. New moon occurs when the Moon is between Earth and the Sun, and thus the side of the Moon that is in shadow faces Earth. Full moon occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, and thus the side of the Moon that is illuminated faces Earth. First and last quarter, in which half the Moon appears illuminated, occur when the Moon is at a right angle with respect to the Sun when viewed from Earth. The waxing and waning crescent phases occur when about one-fourth of the Moon is illuminated, and the waxing and waning gibbous phases occur when about three-fourths of the Moon is illuminated. Earth, as seen from the Moon, shows the same phases in opposite order; e.g., Earth is full when the Moon is new.
