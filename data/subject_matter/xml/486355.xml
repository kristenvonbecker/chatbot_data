  Rappaccini, a scholar-scientist in Padua, grows only poisonous plants in his lush garden. His lovely daughter, Beatrice, has been nurtured on poison and is sustained by her father’s toxic plants. Giovanni, a student who lives next door to Rappaccini, falls in love with Beatrice and becomes contaminated by the garden’s poisonous aura. The antidote he is given cures him; when he gives it to Beatrice, however, she drinks it and dies.
