  , (born May 7, 1837, Stetten, Württemberg [Germany]—died April 4, 1875, Stuttgart, Ger.), explorer who made geologic and archaeological discoveries in southern Africa, notably goldfields in Hartley Hills (1867) and the ruins of the ancient city of Zimbabwe.

  After an unsatisfying few years as a private tutor, Mauch gave up teaching and hired on with a shipping company. He arrived in South Africa in 1865, found a Swedish patron, and began the first of a long series of journeys into the uncharted interior in May 1866. Though not formally trained in geology, Mauch was a keen observer, noting in his journals geologic and botanical data (including the distribution of the tsetse fly and the elevations of mountains) that have contributed to the paleontology of southern Africa. His charts of the area were the first maps of southeast Africa in the more than 200 years since the Portuguese had undertaken the mapping of Mozambique.

  Mauch began the search for the Zimbabwe ruins (which he wrongly believed were those of the ancient biblical city of Ophir, the capital of the Queen of Sheba) and finally sighted and mapped the city in 1871 after a long and trouble-plagued journey.
