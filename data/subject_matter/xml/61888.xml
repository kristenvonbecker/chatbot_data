  The association of pulse with the action of the heart was recognized by the ancient Egyptians, and it remains a valuable indicator of cardiac function in modern medicine. Pulse rate, strength, and rhythm all provide valuable diagnostic information; for example, the regular alteration between strong and weak pulses can indicate

  Pulse rates vary from person to person. The normal pulse rate of an adult at rest may range from 50 to 85 beats per minute, although the average rate is about 70 to 72 for men and 78 to 82 for women. In infants the rate ranges from 110 to 140; the rate decreases with age, and the rate for adolescents is 80 to 90; the normal rate for the elderly may be 50 to 70.
