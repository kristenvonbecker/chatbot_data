  used in personality questionnaires or attitude surveys to gauge the differences in feelings and perceptions on certain topics between individuals. Normative measurements usually present one statement at a time and allow respondents to quantify their agreement with the statement by using a five-point measure very similar to the

  . Scoring of normative scales is fairly straightforward: items receive a 5 when the respondent marks the statement as “strongly agree,” items receive a –5 when the respondent marks the statement as “strongly disagree,” and intermediate items receive scores between the two extremes. Despite occasional debates on the ordinal (rank order) versus interval (level of difference) nature of normative scales, many similar items may be combined into a scale score and used to calculate means and standard deviations. Thus, norms can be established so that people can be compared with each other.
