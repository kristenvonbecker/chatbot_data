  of the family
  <xref articleid="24866">
   Colubridae

  known for its heavy-bodied form, small head, and enlarged nose shield for digging. Bull snakes are nonvenomous and can be found in sandy open country and in pine barrens of western
  <xref articleid="110716">
   North America,
  </xref>
  from
  <xref articleid="110599">
   British Columbia

  and from
  <xref articleid="111278">
   California
  </xref>
  east to
  <xref articleid="111256">

  </xref>
  . These snakes are called bull snakes over much of their range; however, in the western
  <xref articleid="111233">
   United States
  </xref>
  they are often called gopher snakes. They are related to pine snakes (
  <e type="italic">
   Pituophis melanoleucus
  </e>
  ) of the eastern and southern United States and the Mexican bull snake (
  <e type="italic">
   P. deppei

  ) of north-central and western Mexico.

  Bull snakes reach 2.5 metres (8 feet) in length. Their typical coloration is yellowish brown or cream-coloured, with dark blotches. They are mainly fossorial (burrowing); however, they often cross open land and climb
  <xref articleid="108708">
   trees
  </xref>
  in search of prey, which is mainly
  <xref articleid="105980">
   rodents
  </xref>
  but also includes
  <xref articleid="105921">
   birds
  </xref>
  and
  <xref articleid="110254">
   lizards
  </xref>
  . In defense they hiss loudly and thrash about while vibrating their
  <xref articleid="70967">
   tail
  </xref>
  , and they may bite. As a result, they are frequently mistaken for
  <xref articleid="62782">
   rattlesnakes
  </xref>
  . Bull snakes are egg-layers, and females deposit their
  <xref articleid="111130">
   eggs
  </xref>
  in burrows they excavate themselves or those abandoned by small
  <xref articleid="105972">
   mammals
  </xref>
  .

 <p>
  The
  <xref articleid="438741">
   International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources
  </xref>
  (IUCN) classifies the bull snake as a species of least concern. Although its
  <xref articleid="108576">
   population
  </xref>
  is considered to be stable throughout its range, a number of local populations have declined, as their habitats have been transformed by agriculture and urban development.
