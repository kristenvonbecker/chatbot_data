  , in oceanography, circular plate about 30 centimetres (one foot) in diameter, painted a flat white and designed to measure water transparency. It is first lowered into the water until the disk is just barely perceptible, then lowered further until it is no longer visible, and finally raised until it is again just barely perceptible. The average of the depths at the two points of bare visibility is recorded; the greater the depth, the more transparent the water.
