  Pigments for black come from carbon, especially that obtained from burnt vines or bones, or from artificial chemical compounds. Traditional black ink from China, often called

  , is usually made from soot mixed with animal glue; it is highly prized for its durability and opacity.

  In addition to the gray scale, various colour systems have been used to classify black. Before the invention of colour photography,
  <e type="italic">
   Werner’s Nomenclature of Colour
  </e>
  (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint “Raven Black” is compared to the “Berry of Deadly Night-Shade” and “Oliven Ore.” In the
  <xref articleid="54295">
   Munsell colour system

  —adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry—absolute black has a value of 0.
