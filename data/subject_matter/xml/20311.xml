  CARE was formed in 1945 as an umbrella organization for a group of U.S. and Canadian associations working to help rebuild war-torn western Europe. Rather than disband after Europe had recovered, the organization extended its services to the less-developed countries of the world, and many western European countries formed their own branches of CARE.

  Working through the host governments, with an emphasis on shared cost and self-help programs, CARE organizes a number of projects, including land management, soil conservation, food distribution, nutrition, and nutrition education. Since 1962, CARE’s services also have included the Medical International Cooperation Organization (MEDICO; founded 1958), which gives health care workers training for service to remote rural areas.
